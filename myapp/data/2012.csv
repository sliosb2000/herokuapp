Elektra's stock has more than doubled in the past year, pushing Salinas' fortune up by $9.2 billion; Elektra revenue grew 19% in peso terms in 2011 to $4.1 billion. Analysts point to a very small float as one reason for the large increase in value of Elektra's share price; an equity swap with UBS and a new place on the benchmark IPC Mexican stock index further reduced supply and drove share prices higher. In mid 2010, Salinas took his financially troubled Mexican wireless carrier Iusacell private; he owned 75%. He struck a deal in 2011 to sell a 50% stake of Iusacell to competing Mexican TV broadcaster Televisa for $1.6 billion, but in February 2012 the Mexican national competition commission vetoed the plan. Televisa and Iusacell are appealing. It's all part of the ongoing telecom battle with Carlos Slim, whose company Telcel controls 70% of the Mexican mobile market; Iusacell has a mere 4% market share.

In February, as the 23-year-old turned around the New York Knicks' losing streak, Nike wisely extended Lin's contract. In 2011, the firm signed boxing champion Manny Pacquiao and released a ""Pacman"" product line similar to Michael Jordan's. Knight, a former University of Oregon track star, founded Blue Ribbon sports in 1964, selling Japanese running shoes out of the trunk of his car at track meets on the weekends while teaching accounting at Portland State. He renamed his company Nike after the Greek goddess of Victory in 1971 and paid then-graphic design student Carolyn Davidson $35 to design the company's iconic swoosh logo.

517,Billionaires,2012,3,steve-wynn,"Steve Wynn spent much of 2011 battling with his partner, Japanese billionaire slot machine tycoon Kazuo Okada, who was the largest shareholder and director of Wynn Resorts Ltd. In February, Wynn dismissed Okada from the board of directors and forcibly bought out his 20% stake, filing suit against Okada in Nevada. Wynn had hired former FBI director Louis Freeh to investigate Okada. Freeh's report claims that Okada violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act when he gave gifts and payments worth more than $100,000 to gaming officials in the Philippines, where Okada is building a casino. Okada disputes Wynn's charges. Besides the feud, Wynn had a busy 2011. He and NFL Patriots owner Robert Kraft lobbied for support of a possible Wynn-owned casino to be located across from the football stadium in Foxboro, Mass. In December, local politicians voted down the plan. In November, a Nevada judge ruled that Wynn's policy of pooling tips for dealers in his Nevada casinos violates state law, sending the fight to the state supreme court. Shares of Wynn's casino empire peaked in July but then dropped significantly toward the end of the year. In 2010 he partnered with online poker site, PokerStars, but severed ties in April after the U.S. government clamped down on Internet gambling.

Slim's phone companies Telmex and Telcel as well as retailers belonging to Grupo Carso pulled their advertising from Televisa in 2011 after Televisa increased ad rates by 20%.

Jim graduated from Southern Methodist U., working his way up from the Colts' ticket counter to general manager in two years. His father's 1997 death ignited a legal battle with his stepmother for team control; Jim emerged as the NFL's youngest owner at 37. He earned his first Super Bowl ring with the Colts' 2006 victory over the Chicago Bears; the team is worth more than $1 billion today.  The Colts have one of the best stadium deals in the NFL for their $720 million Lucas Oil Stadium, which opened in 2008.

NFL-leading streak of nine straight playoff appearances ended this year after quarterback Peyton Manning suffered a herniated disk in his neck and missed the entire season.

Currently, the question swirling around the organization is whether the Colts will draft No. 1 college recruit Andrew Luck and play the Stanford great ahead of Manning, who has said he will play in 2012.

Gerry's original cable system only had the capability to transmit five channels at a time, despite access to seven networks. As such, Gerry often found himself changing channels for the whole region, sometimes swapping out a news program for the Yankees game and vice versa. By the 1990s his Cablevision Industries had established cable networks in 18 states from New York to Florida. Gerry sold CVI to Time Warner in 1996 for $2.8 billion, netting himself $900 million in the deal. Rather than getting back into the business, the self-described ""country boy,"" who grew up in Sullivan County, New York, purchased the site of the 1969 Woodstock festival at the urging of his youngest daughter, opening the Bethel Woods Center for the Arts in 2006. The main pavilion at Bethel Woods seats 17,000 and has hosted artists from the Grateful Dead and Willie Nelson to Elton John and the New York Philharmonic Orchestra. Gerry has been known to plant and harvest an annual corn crop on his Sullivan County farm, and hopes that Bethel Woods will help drive an economic resurgence in the region.
