He clocks in at $4 billion more than a year ago, thanks to surging stock prices at his financial arm, Grupo Financiero Inbursa, and at his Grupo Carso industrial and retail giant. Pan-Latin American mobile telecom outfit America Movil remains his most valuable holding at $36.3 billion; the company spread its wings to Europe in the past year, buying pieces of Dutch telecom company KPN and Telekom Austria. Other listed companies focus on mining, real estate and infrastructure. Slim does not hold an executive position at any of the companies he controls, but remains engaged and advises on strategy. He put his sons, Carlos, Marco Antonio and Patrick, in charge of the industrial, finance and telecom companies he controls.In September America Movil bought stakes in two Mexican professional soccer teams; in November Slim bought a majority of struggling Spanish soccer team Real Oviedo. Early 2013 saw a surge in Slim's philanthropic activity. The Carlos Slim Foundation pledged to translate into Spanish 1,000 videos from the Khan Academy education nonprofit website.

Not that there's any chance of that: Gates has already given more than $28 billion, but said in his fifth annual letter for the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation that the total amount invested is less important than precise measures of impact, like child mortality rates. Gates has been spreading his gospel to other billionaires near and far: he and good friend Warren Buffett recently added 12 non-Americans to their Giving Pledge, including the U.K.'s Richard Branson and India's Azim Premji, bumping the total to 105 high net worth individuals. He also partnered with Carlos Slim to build a new $25 million agricultural research center in Mexico. Gates' net worth increased $6 billion to $67 billion in the past year - with no help from the company he cofounded, Microsoft, in which he still has a 5% stock. Most of his fortune these days is spread across private equity, bonds, and stocks like hygiene tech firm Ecolab, Mexican TV broadcaster Televisa, and Latin America's largest beverage company FEMSA.

Heinz Co. for $23.2 billion. It wasn't the only deal for Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway lately. In November 2012 Berkshire acquired Omaha-based party supplier Oriental Trading Co. and in December 2012 the company purchased $1.2 billion of its own stock from ""the estate of a longtime shareholder."" Buffett completed radiation treatment for prostate cancer last summer, five months after he notified Berkshire Hathaway shareholders of his condition, assuring them that it was ""not remotely life-threatening."" Still, he has gotten his house in order: In December 2011 he chose his farmer son, Howard, as the future non-executive chairman and ""guardian of the firm's values."" In February 2012 he said he'd picked his CEO replacement but has declined to give a name. Buffett has also been busy expanding his philanthropy. He gave $1.5 billion to the Gates Foundation in July 2012, bringing his lifetime giving to nearly $17.3 billion. On his birthday in August 2012 Buffett pledged $3 billion of stock to his children's foundations. After studying under Benjamin Graham at Columbia Business School, Buffett offered to work for his former professor's investment partnership, Graham-Newman Corporation, for free. According to Buffett, ""he turned me down as overvalued."" It was only after several years of ""pestering"" that the father of value investing agreed to take on the younger man in 1954. When Graham retired two years later, Buffett returned to Nebraska to launch his own partnership. In 1962 Buffett began buying up shares of a struggling textile company called Berkshire Hathaway.

In March 2012, Bezos Expeditions discovered the lost engines from the Apollo 11 lunar mission on the ocean floor, and is planning an attempt to bring them to the surface. Bezos also funnels money into aerospace firm Blue Origin, a West Texas-based research and development outfit working to create a vertical take-off and landing rocket. While Bezos and wife Mackenzie are notoriously private, they made headlines in July 2012 for a rare public donation: $2.5 million to Washington United for Marriage, a group backing Referendum 74, which would legalize same-sex marriage in the couple's home state. All of this is made possible by the huge success of Amazon.com, whose stock has been surging over the past year. The retailer, which reported $61 billion in 2012 sales, up $13 billion from the previous year, continues to separate from the pack on service and speed, adding 20 new shipment hubs in 2012. In the meantime, he's looking to add robots to his workforce: in March 2012, Amazon bought robotics firm Kiva Systems for $775 million in hopes of speeding up its order fulfillment process.

The firm's performance trailed the U.S. stock market in 2012, but was firmly in positive territory, thanks partly to a big bet against the yen.

Outspoken on world economic policies and an unapologetic proponent of European integration, Soros has recently declared that the euro is ""here to stay."" Since 1979 Soros has given away $8.5 billion to human rights, education and public health groups; $6 billion has gone to international causes and estimated $400 million to fight poverty.

In what could be the biggest leveraged buy-out of recent years, Michael Dell and his investment partners at Silver Lake struck an agreement in February with Dell's board to acquire the company he founded in 1984 for $24.4 billion. Several prominent shareholders like Southeastern Asset Management have pledged to block the deal, arguing that the bid undervalues the company. The Texas-born mogul is intent on transforming the struggling PC maker into a storage, server and software business beyond the scrutiny of public shareholders. His firm bought California-based Quest Software in 2012 in a $2.4 billion deal as the first big step in this effort. Today the bulk of Michael Dell's fortune is tied up in his investment firm MSD Capital; its portfolio includes banking, property, dental practices and landscaping companies.

Ballmer is now in his 13th year as CEO and, with a stock down 1.32% over the past five years, he continues to be dogged with criticism he's been on the job too long. Ballmer insists he still has fight left in him, but signs point toward an exit even if one is not imminent. He delivered his last keynote last year at the all-important CES trade show and sold $1.5 billion shares of Microsoft in 2011. As for retirement plans, the basketball-loving Ballmer is leading a group of investors buying the NBA's Sacramento Kings with plans to move them to a new $490 million arena in Seattle. Ballmer grew up in the suburbs of Detroit. His father, a Swiss immigrant, was a midlevel manager for Ford Motor Co. Ballmer won a scholarship to a prestigious private day school, scored a perfect 800 on his math SATs and graduated Harvard with a BA in math and economics.

A Harvard history grad, Alejandro is the eldest son from the jet-setting beer magnate's second marriage. In 2005, Julio Mario swapped control of his Bavaria brewery for 15% of SABMiller, which makes more than 150 brands, including Blue Moon beer. The Santo Domingo Group has since reduced its holdings to 14.1%, a stake now worth nearly $11.2 billion. Other assets, owned via publicly traded Valorem S.A., include a controlling interest in Colombia's biggest TV broadcaster, Caracol and in forestry outfit Refocosta, and shares in packaging maker Biofilm. Born into a rich family with interests in breweries, Julio Mario Santo Domingo took over management of its holdings in 1972 after his father retired. Now Alejandro, a managing director at Quadrant Capital Advisors, a New York-based investment advisory firm, is filling the role he has been groomed for over many years. In 2012, Quadrant led a $32 million investment in online clothing store Dafiti; Santo Domingo also purchased, through Grupo Santo Domingo, a 3% stake in Chile's Corpbanca for $100 million; and bought a majority stake in Integral de Servicios Tecnicos, a supplier for the oil industry. Alejandro sits on the board of Valorem, and, since 2009, the board of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. The family owns a private island, Baru, off the Caribbean coast of Colombia. Alejandro's younger brother Andres appears in U.S. gossip columns with socialite wife, Vogue magazine editor Lauren Davis. Julio Mario Jr., half-brother to Alejandro and Andres from their father's first marriage, died in 2009 in New York, reportedly from cancer.

Assets under management at Paulson & Co. stand at $18 billion, down from $36 billion in early 2011. Long bullish on gold, Paulson now seems to have faith in real estate. One of his funds picked up 875 acres in Las Vegas in 2012. For himself, he bought a 90-acre home and ranch called Hala Ranch in Aspen, Colorado, and a nearby 38-acre parcel known as Bear Cabin from a Saudi prince for $49 million. A former managing director of M&A at Bear Stearns, he founded his hedge fund firm in 1994 and became a billionaire in 2007 by shorting subprime mortgage securities, earning a $3.5 billion payout. In 2010, his take was $4.9 billion, a record for the hedge fund industry. An NYU alum and trustee, he donated $20 million to the school in 2009; he gave $5 million to Southampton Hospital, near his summer home, and is donating $15 million to a new maternity hospital in Guayaquil, Ecuador, where his father, after whom it is being named, was born.

For many years, Forbes has excluded the value of those shares, believing them to be irrevocably owned and controlled by a charity. It turns out that the foundation is a limited liability company with a charitable purpose, over which Tschira has full control. As a result, Forbes is including the shares owned by the foundation as part of Tschira's net worth. Tschira co-founded SAP in 1972 with five former IBM colleagues --three of whom are also billionaires (Hasso Plattner, Dietmar Hopp and Hans Werner Hector). It has grown to be one of the world's largest software firms, with $18.5 billion revenue in 2011. He retired from the company in 1998 and stepped down from its supervisory board in 2007. His Klaus Tschira Foundation is one of Germany's largest philanthropic organizations, with assets of $2.7 billion. It supports scientific research and cultural projects such as a youth software prize given to students who explain math or science matters through the clever use of software.

190,Billionaires,2013,3,eli-broad,"In November 2012 Eli Broad returned to his alma mater, Michigan State University, to inaugurate the Eli and Edythe Broad Art Museum, a project to which he had donated $28 million. The son of Lithuanian immigrants, he was born in the Bronx and raised in Detroit. He bought his first real estate at age 20 and co-founded the home builder Kaufman & Broad in 1957 with $25,000 borrowed from his in-laws. It became one of the nation's biggest home builders by supplying parents of baby boomers with affordable housing. In 1971 he bought Sun Life Insurance (later renamed SunAmerica), and he sold it to AIG in 1998 for $18 billion in cash and stock. Now he largely devotes himself to philanthropy, and he has already given an estimated $3.5 billion (more than 50% of his current net worth) to charity, including $600 million to found the Broad Institute for biomedical research at Harvard and MIT. He and wife, Edythe, created the Broad Art Foundation in 1984; it now owns more than $2.4 billion in art, which it lends to contemporary art to institutions around the world. The couple is building The Broad, a new contemporary art museum and worldwide headquarters for their foundation, to open in Los Angeles in early 2014. ""My wife, Edye, and I have been blessed with extraordinary success,"" Broad told Forbes. ""We consider it a privilege to invest our resources in making life better for people by improving public education, advancing scientific and medical research and fostering public appreciation of the arts."" He is also the largest donor to, and sits on the board of, the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles. He was one of that museum's earliest donors and made its construction possible. MOCA has been embroiled in infighting and leadership changes, with charges of mismanagement and difficulty generating donations. Following the financial crisis, Broad promised $30 million in additional gifts to it to be distributed as matching gifts. He also gave his blessing to the museum's naming of a businessman as its director, and some have charged that the museum's artistic integrity has suffered as a result. Broad is a member of the Giving Pledge and, like Warren Buffett, supports higher taxes for the rich. ""Those of us who have gained great success have an obligation to pay more taxes,"" he told Forbes in 2011.

Formerly owned by Consolidated Edison Inc., the plot is zoned for two apartment towers. Solow originally bought the parcel, plus another larger one, in 2005 for $630 million, when he was planning a seven-building, $4 billion project along New York City's East River. The project stalled because of a lawsuit between Solow and his business partner, the Fisher & Company real estate firm. That suit suit settled in 2010, and Solow put the smaller parcel up for sale. In May 2012, Citigroup won dismissal of a Solow lawsuit alleging that the firm committed securities fraud during the 2008 financial crisis. In early February 2013, Solow sued Citbank, B of A, JP Morgan, alleging that the banks colluded to manipulate the libor rate, which had an impact on his bond portfolio. The Brooklyn-born son of a bricklayer, he was a small-time builder when he risked everything on one Manhattan high-rise in 1972. That building is now the prestigious 9 West 57th Street, with tenants like KKR and Apollo Global Management.

In 2012 he continued a long-running ""will he, won't he?"" game with the press, claiming to have seriously entertained the idea of running for president. He didn't, but loudly disputed President Obama's birth certificate while stumping for Mitt Romney. In 2013 he started some new celebrity feuds to add to his laundry list from the past, threatening to sue comedian Bill Maher following a joke about the mogul's own birth certificate, attacking young rapper Mac Miller for using his name in a song and sparring on Twitter with fellow billionaire Mark Cuban over everything from TV ratings to philanthropy. The Donald continues to collect prime real estate, most recently Miami's Doral golf and spa resort and Washington, D.C.'s Old Post Office building, which he's redeveloping as a luxury hotel. He's also still raking it in as a one-man brand: he was number 17 on Forbes' Celebrity 100 list in 2012, mostly thanks to the success of his Apprentice franchise. The Trump name can also be found on alcohol, neckties, high-end mattresses and, as of March, a fragrance collection for men called Success by Trump. His controversial $150 million golf course in Scotland opened for business in July 2012.

523,Billionaires,2013,3,steve-wynn,"Casino magnate Steve Wynn watched fourth-quarter 2012 profits at his Wynn Resorts fall 40% thanks in part to lower revenue at the gambling empire's properties in Macau, which competes for business with properties owned by fellow billionaire Sheldon Adelson. Wynn operates two casinos in Macau and is building a third on the Cotai Strip. He also has plans to build a $1 billion casino in Everett, Mass. and another in Fishtown, a neighborhood in Philadelphia. In November 2012, Wynn shareholders enjoyed an $7.50-per-share special dividend. Also throughout 2012, the gambling tycoon continued to spar with former business partner and fellow billionaire Kazuo Okada. In the latest scrimmage in an ongoing war, Okada stepped down from the board of Wynn Resorts and vowed to fight Steve Wynn's seizure of Okada's nearly 20 percent stake in the resort empire, which Wynn wrested away from Okada in 2012 at a 30 percent discount. Okada, who made his fortune in pachinko--Japanese slot machines--was once the largest shareholder and a director of Wynn Resorts Ltd. In February 2012, Wynn forcibly bought out Okada's 20% stake and filed suit against the Japanese billionaire in Nevada. Wynn Resorts hired former FBI director Louis Freeh (author of the Freeh Report on the Jerry Sandusky sex abuse scandal at Penn State) to investigate Okada. Freeh's report claims that Okada violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act when he gave gifts and payments worth more than $100,000 to gaming officials in the Philippines, where Okada is building a casino. Although Okada disputes the charges and has countered with a suit attempting to take back his stake, he is now facing an FBI probe in relation to his activities in the Philippines. Meanwhile, Steve Wynn's ex-wife Elaine Wynn has claimed the Okada brouhaha nullifies an agreement that requires Steve Wynn's approval to sell her shares. Steve Wynn owns a 14-room penthouse apartment above the Ritz-Carlton on Central Park South, and paid $70 million for it, one of the highest prices ever paid for an apartment in New York City. In January 2010 Wynn divorced his wife, Elaine, for the second time. She is a billionaire by virtue of her stake in Wynn Resorts.

While in his 20s, he became a friend of Joseph Kabila, who then ran the military and is now the DRC's president. Since Kabila became president, Gertler has paid state-owned entities undisclosed amounts for mining rights; good governance and other nonprofit groups have accused him of using his ties to the president to pay below market levels, essentially robbing the government of the land's great resource wealth.

The firm was founded by Fortunato Brescia Tassano, first as a real estate company that capitalized on Lima's growth. When Fortunato died in 1951, his sons Pedro and Mario took control. Since then, the company has expanded into a multitude of other businesses including agriculture, fish products, cement, paint products and mining. In 1969, the Peruvian government took control of the firm's agriculture companies and in 1973, it expropriated its fishery business. But later Grupo Breca regained a foothold in the fish products business with Tecnologica de Alimentos SA (TASA), now one of the largest producers of fish meal and fish oil in the world. Pedro gave his shares in the companies to his nephews and his sister, Ana María. Mario's sons own 40% of Grupo Breca. The firm also owns mining subsidiary Minsur, which has tin mines in Peru and Brazil. In 2012 Minsur bought 70% of Mina Justa, a copper project in Peru, for $505 million.

883,Billionaires,2013,3,carl-bennet,"Perhaps one of the least known billionaire owners of publicly held corporations, 61-year-old Swedish industrialist Carl Bennet joins the ranks of the world's billionaires after hiding in plain sight for years. Through Carl Bennet AB, an investing vehicle that he owns outright, he holds stakes in seven companies that span a wide range of industries: medical products, biomedical research, printing, dental products, forestry and investing. The most lucrative of those investments is publicly traded medical products company Getinge Group, where he has served as chairman since 1997. He is beneficial owner of a fifth of that company, but through shrewd share divisions he claims nearly half of its voting rights. In total his stake in Getinge is worth $1.5 billion. A similar share structure has been employed at Elanders, a printing company where Bennet controls 59% of the equity and 73% of the voting rights. But the value of Elanders has plummeted since 2007; it is now worth a mere 15% of what it was then. Bennet is also the sole owner of LIFCO, a company that mainly makes dental products but also produces machinery and tools, environmental technology and sawmill equipment. Little is known about Bennet's personal life, but he began on his path to billionaire status when he and fellow investor Rune Andersson acquired Getinge, then a money-losing company, from Electrolux, in 1989. He served as CEO and president, Andersson as chairman. Getinge began producing a profit in 1991. When it debuted on the Stockholm Stock Exchange, in 1993, Bennet and Andersson sold off 57% of their equity for roughly $60 million, which they later invested in other companies. The duo owned Getinge through Andersson & Bennet, a company that was dissolved in 1997 when they parted ways. Bennet took over the holding company, which became Carl Bennet AB, and in turn Getinge. Andersson took on three other businesses they had owned together.",882,billionaires,1700.0,Finance and Investments,0,13.0,"{'name': 'Carl Bennet', 'uri': 'carl-bennet', 'imageExists': False, 'squareImage': '//specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/5e77c36f10380d0006fbc5ec/416x416.jpg?background=000000&cropX1=560&cropX2=2262&cropY1=63&cropY2=1766'}",True,Carl Bennet,61.0,Sweden,Gothenberg,investments,['Finance and Investments'],Sweden,,1491251789477,19,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,faris/5/2013/193362,884,False,,,True,N,M,-579729600000.0,201.0,Bennet,Carl,The World's Billionaires,,,http://onforb.es/1IR6Yer,,http://onforb.es/1IR71XC,1362373200000,False,False,http://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/5e77c36f10380d0006fbc5ec/280x425.jpg?fit=scale&background=000000,//specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/5e77c36f10380d0006fbc5ec/416x416.jpg?background=000000&cropX1=560&cropX2=2262&cropY1=63&cropY2=1766,False,,,"['rank', 'finalWorth', 'personName', 'bios', 'bio']",False,,,,,,,,,,,

Known for firing off harsh letters lambasting corporate executives and board members of companies he is targeting, in 2012 Loeb led a successful effort to dislodge Scott Thompson from the CEO position at Yahoo and replace him with Marissa Mayer. He also joined Yahoo's board of directors. The stock has been a winner for Loeb as has been his activist position in Murphy Oil. Loeb made news in early 2013 by taking a position in Herbalife, the nutritional supplements seller, shortly after another prominent hedge fund manager, William Ackman, called the company a pyramid scheme. He sold part of his stake within weeks. He serves as the chairman of the board of Success Academies Charter Schools in Brooklyn, helps lead Students First New York., and is a trustee of Prep for Prep.

Steyer's last year at Farallon was decent enough, with his flagship hedge fund returning 11.42% net, though the performance trailed the U.S. stock market. He has clearly been bitten by the political bug. In early September he spoke at the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, North Carolina, where he served as a delegate. He was the primary backer of California ballot initiative Prop. 39, which passed in 2012. It closed a corporate tax loophole that lets multistate businesses choose to pay taxes outside of California and use the tax funds for alternative energy projects; he contributed some $22 million to get the measure passed. In 2010, Steyer successfully led the opposition to a California ballot initiative that would have quashed a law limiting greenhouse gas emissions. Steyer continues to back the Advanced Energy Economy business organization, which he cofounded. It is working to help American alternative energy companies succeed. He donated $10 million in 2012 to its affiliated nonprofit Advanced Energy Economy Institute. He and his wife, Kat Taylor, were among the first to sign the Gates-Buffett Giving Pledge in 2010. The couple gave $25 million to Steyer's alma mater, Yale University, in 2011 to establish an energy sciences institute. They also gave $40 million to Stanford University (where Steyer got his MBA) in 2009 to establish the TomKat Center for Sustainable Energy and another $7 million in 2010 to create the Steyer-Taylor Center for Energy Finance and Policy. In 2004, they created a foundation to start a community bank, One Pacific Coast Bank, and have so far spent $50 million to fund it.

1093,Billionaires,2013,3,christopher-goldsbury,"Following his 1967 wedding to Linda Marie Pace, Christopher ?Kit? Goldsbury started his career cutting vegetables in the production line of her father's Pace salsa factory. In 1977, he was named president of the company and by 1982, he and Linda Marie Pace had bought out her family's remaining interests in the firm. Following the couple's 1987 divorce, Goldsbury purchased Linda's half for just $95 million. Eight years later, he sold the entire outfit to Campbell Soup for $1.1 billion. Goldsbury soon jumped back into the food industry via Silver Ventures, which has a stake in tomato producer NatureSweet. His investments appear to be paying off; Goldsbury sold artisanal bread maker Ecce Panis to Campbell for a reported $65 million in 2009. With a record $35 million donation to the Culinary Institute of America in 2007, Goldsbury recruited the cooking school to open a campus on the site of the former Pearl Brewery in San Antonio, which Goldsbury's private equity firm Silver Ventures purchased in 2001. Goldsbury established a $20 million scholarship fund called El Sueño to subsidize education costs for low-income students attending the culinary school. Pearl Park, home to a music venue that seats 1,000, opened last year, and the area now boasts numerous stores, a spa and upscale restaurants.

A noted conservationist, he fended off a different kind of intervention when he successfully fought efforts by two power companies to build a power line across his Trinchera Ranch in Colorado. In 2012, he announced his intentions to donate a conservation easement on 90,000 acres of land on Trinchera (bought from Forbes family in 2007) to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Including that land, Bacon has set aside close to 200,000 acres through 10 easements including 424 acres on Robins Island in New York's Peconic Bay, and 3,000 acres on his ancestor's original plantation down south. The easements protect the land in perpetuity; they also have tax benefits. According to Bacon, he has given around $50 million to mostly environmental groups. At age 20, he spent the summer working on the fishing boat of NYSE board member Walter Frank, which later led to a job at Frank's specialist firm. Bacon's stepmother is Julian Robertson's sister.

According to friends, he would work 18-hour days in his bedroom, only emerging to show off new features and occasionally declare that his product would make him a millionaire.  GoPro came out with its first camera, a 35-millimeter waterproof film version, in 2004. Today, the camera shoots full video in cinema quality HD, allowing anyone from professional surfer Kelly Slater to amatuer snowboarders to capture their adventures. Revenues, which surpassed $500 million in 2012, have nearly doubled every year since the company's creation and Woodman maintains that GoPro has been profitable from day one. In December 2012, Taiwan-based electronics manufacturer Foxconn made a $200 million investment in the company for an 8.88%. At a $2.25 billion valuation, that backing made Woodman, who owns nearly half the company according to sources close to the company, a billionaire.

After the Wendy's transaction he became the fast food chain's largest shareholder, gaining more than 16 million shares. By 2003 he had sold off all his Wendy's shares, enjoying a considerable pop in the stock in the intervening years.
