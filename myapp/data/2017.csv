The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation is also working to improve K-12 education in the U.S., an area in which it's had fewer tangible results.The richest person in the world for 18 out of the past 23 years, Gates stepped down as Microsoft chairman in 2014 but remains a technology advisor and board member of the company he cofounded in 1975. Gates sells his Microsoft shares on a regular basis and now owns 2.3% of the company, which in turn accounts for 13% of his fortune. He also has investments in Canadian National Railway, tractor maker Deere & Co. and car dealer AutoNation. In December 2016, Gates announced the creation of a $1 billion Breakthrough Energy investment fund with about 20 other people - including Amazon.com CEO Jeff Bezos and Alibaba founder Jack Ma - to invest in new forms of clean energy.",1,billionaires,86000.0,Technology,0,1.0,"{'name': 'Bill Gates', 'uri': 'bill-gates', 'imageExists': True, 'squareImage': 'https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/62d599ede3ff49f348f9b9b4/416x416.jpg?background=000000&cropX1=155&cropX2=976&cropY1=340&cropY2=1161'}",True,Bill Gates,61.0,United States,Washington,Medina,Microsoft,['Technology'],United States,Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation,1498160331605,102,0.0,0.0,0.0,faris/5/2017/5772,1,True,11000.0,14.666666666666671,True,U,M,-447451200000.0,225.0,Gates,Bill,The World's Billionaires,Cofounder,"{'name': 'Bill &#38; Melinda Gates Foundation', 'title': 'Cofounder', 'totalEarningEst': False, 'salaryEst': False, 'government': False}",1489982400000,False,False,8.0,1.0,http://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/62d599ede3ff49f348f9b9b4/280x425.jpg?fit=scale&background=000000,West,"Seattle-Tacoma-Bellevue, WA",https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/62d599ede3ff49f348f9b9b4/416x416.jpg?background=000000&cropX1=155&cropX2=976&cropY1=340&cropY2=1161,False,"['rank', 'finalWorth', 'personName', 'bios', 'bio']",False,"['When Bill Gates was a kid, he spent so much time reading that his parents finally forbid him to bring books to the dinner table.

This follows Wang's January 2016 purchase of L.A. production firm Legendary Entertainment and his 2012 acquisition of U.S. movie house chain AMC Theatres. In December 2016, Wang issued a warning to President-elect Trump that thousands of U.S. jobs -- at places like AMC Theatres -- would be at risk if Trump prevents further purchases of U.S. companies. Wang, who spent his youth in the military, made his initial fortune in real estate. His Dalian Wanda Commercial Property is the country's largest commercial real estate developer; it delisted from the Hong Kong exchange in September and may relist on a mainland exchange. In May he launched theme park Wanda City in Nanchang, and has plans for 15 theme parks in China and 5 overseas.

In 1946, Wilhelm Schaeffler and his brother Georg (Maria-Elisabeth's husband) founded the manufacturer that became known as INA, which initially only produced wooden buttons and belt buckles. The ball bearing assembly known as the needle cage, which became the foundation for the company's success, was developed by Georg in 1949. Maria-Elisabeth took over in 1996, following the death of Georg (Wilhelm Schaeffler died in 1981). Her son (also named Georg), who served two years in the German armed forces, worked for Schaeffler Group from 1990 to 1996. Following his father's death, Georg studied law in the U.S. and wound up practicing international business law in Dallas. (His younger brother Christian died from an electric shock in 1975, after a hair dryer fell into the bathtub.) In 2008, Schaeffler Group announced a $15-billion, debt-financed takeover of publicly traded tire and auto parts giant Continental AG. Georg joined his mother in running Schaeffler in 2009. For a while, in the wake of the worldwide financial crisis, it looked as if the high-wire act might all come crashing down. But as the auto market rebounded, Continental's share price soared and the Schaefflers continued to pay down debt via Continental share sales and excess cash flow. Through Schaeffler Group and its parent, Schaeffler Verwaltungs GmbH, Maria-Elisabeth and Georg now own 46% of Continental. In 2015, they took Schaeffler public and within half a year sold all preferred non-voting shares of the company.

In June 2015, it announced plans to create more than 2,500 jobs in the U.K. as part of a $2 billion-plus, three-year expansion program there. Schwarz regularly appeared on Forbes' annual billionaires ranking in the 1990s but was taken off the list in 1999 after making the case to Forbes that he had transferred his ownership of Lidl to a charitable foundation. He returned to the list in 2013, after research showed that the Dieter Schwarz Foundation is a limited liability company with a charitable purpose, not a charitable foundation. Dividends are used to fund charitable projects, but Schwarz maintains full control over his shares and can sell them at any time. The Dieter Schwarz Foundation supports education and daycare facilities for children, science and research projects as well as other activities. In 2011, the Bildungscampus der Dieter Schwarz Stiftung opened in Heilbronn. The university campus, funded by the foundation, houses a graduate school of management and law as well as other higher education offerings.

Thiele, coming from poor background and ambitiously working his way through law school, joined the firm's legal department in the late 1960s, at age 28, and quickly ascended the ranks. When the grandson of founder/inventor Georg Knorr decided to sell his ownership stake, the company found itself on the block and Thiele, backed by Deutsche Bank, emerged as controlling shareholder. In the 1990s he turned his attention to U.S. brake specialist Bendix, eventually acquiring the business entirely in 2002 and emerging with a leading position in the U.S. market. Having withdrawn from his position on the operational side of the business in 2007, Thiele has actively chaired the supervisory board and was named honorary chairman in March 2016. He's known to always be highly engaged in the business, so much that it has been difficult to persist next to him; a number of managers have packed their bags and left in the recent years. Even his son Henrik, who was supposed to join the ranks of the board at Knorr-Bremse in July of 2015, suddenly left the company due to differences with his father.

- Galaxy won its Macau casino concession with Sheldon Adelson controlled Las Vegas Sands as its gaming manager. When the two sides couldn't reach terms on a partnership agreement, the government split the concession in two, allowing each to develop its own casinos. That decision eventually doubled the number of Macau casino licensees from three to six.
- Lui donated $1.2 billion in 2015 to endow his foundation and the Lui Che Woo Prize. The Prize annually recognizes achievements in sustainability, human welfare and ""positive energy"" with grants of $2.6 million to three winners.

He'd taken out a loan to recapitalize HeidelbergCement, and used shares he owned in the company as collateral. After Heidelberg stock lost 75% of its value and banks demanded early repayment of the loan and additional collateral, Adolf committed suicide. Subsequently, Ludwig has restructured the group and executed an impressive turnaround. In the fall of 2009, he cut his stake in HeidelbergCement from 74% to 25%. The following year, he sold generic drug maker Ratiopharm to Teva Pharmaceuticals for $5 billion. It looked as if Phoenix Pharma Group might have to go on the block as well, given the extent of the liabilities Adolf had assumed in assembling the drug wholesaler through acquisitions, but the company was saved when banks came through with a syndicated loan facility. Now Phoenix, which also operates more than 1,580 retail pharmacies in 12 countries (many under the brand name BENU), is deleveraging and turning increasing profits.

For a while, in the wake of the ensuing worldwide financial crisis, it looked as if the high-wire act might come crashing down. But as the auto market rebounded, Continental's share price soared and the Schaefflers continued to pay down debt via Continental share sales and excess cash flow. Through Schaeffler Group and its parent, Schaeffler Verwaltungs GmbH, Maria-Elisabeth and Georg now own 46% of Continental. In 2015, they took Schaeffler public and within half a year sold all preferred non-voting shares of the company. While her son leads a secluded life in, Maria-Elisabeth is the public face of Schaeffler. She has received various accolades for her entrepreneurial and civic achievements, as well as for her commitment to social issues and cultural organizations.

340,Billionaires,2017,3,willi-isolde-liebherr,"Willi and Isolde Liebherr's father was one of the most revered industrialists of post-World War II Germany. Hans Liebherr recognized the need for machinery to rebuild his country while managing his parents' construction firm. With the introduction, in 1949, of the first mobile tower crane, Hans Liebherr Maschinenfabrik (Engineering Works) was born, in Kirchdorf. After unveiling the first hydraulic excavator in Europe, in 1953, Hans branched out into appliances, aerospace components and systems, concrete mixers, machine tools, material-handling equipment, diesel engines and climate-control technology. When Hans died in 1993, at age 78, his company had become one of the largest equipment manufacturers in the world. Management control then passed to Willi -- who joined the business in 1971, after earning a mechanical engineering degree from the Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich -- and his sister, Isolde, who joined the business in 1976 after earning a degree in management from the Business School of Mannheim (Germany). They continued to expand the business and eventually, their children assumed management positions within the company. Willi's son Jan shares management responsibility with his father for separate divisions focused on earthmoving machinery and components (diesel and gas engines, fuel-injection systems, hydraulic cylinders, gearboxes, winches, etc.), while sister Sophie Albrecht likewise shares management responsibility with Willi for the mobile cranes and mining divisions (the latter includes equipment such as hydraulic excavators weighing up to 880 tons). Isolde's daughter Stéfanie Wohlfarth shares management duties with her mother for the appliances division and her uncle Willi for the tower cranes company area. Sister Patricia Ruef presides over the maritime cranes division with her mother, while also sharing responsibility with Willi for the machine tools and automation systems division. Today, the Liebherr Group, which also owns six luxury hotels in Ireland, Austria and Germany, employs more than 40,800 people in over 130 companies at sites on every continent (aside from Antarctica).

In an unusual move, shortly before Arista's IPO in 2014, Arista cofounder David Cheriton's firm OptumSoft sued Arista, accusing it of violating the terms of a licensing agreement. A judge rejected those claims in December 2015. A second phase of the suit, regarding OptumSoft's claims that Arista misappropriated trade secrets, is ongoing. Arista is also battling litigation from its bigger rival, Cisco Systems, over copyright and patent infringement allegations. Arista denies all the allegations.

In December 2015, OptumSoft lost the first phase of the legal battle when a judge found that Arista had not violated the terms of a licensing agreement. A second trial over trade-secret allegations is pending. Arista denies the allegations.

Implementing new techniques in milk processing and building up sales and distribution infrastructure, his became the first dairy in Germany to offer nationwide distribution of fresh milk products -- a roll-out supported by advertising campaigns and TV spots featuring sports legends Gerd Mueller (soccer) and Boris Becker (tennis). Today, in addition to dairy subsidiaries, Theo Mueller Group comprises packing, logistics, vehicle maintenance, fruit processing, a fish restaurant chain (Nordsee) and artisanal bakery shops/cafes (Bastian's). Acquisitions have extended the company's presence as well as its product range (e.g., chilled gourmet salad, sauces and dressings). The Luxembourg-based Mueller Group -- which now has 21 production plants in ten countries, employs 27,000 people and generates revenue of around $7 billion -- has been criticized for using genetically-modified animal food, receiving questionable subsidies and for low compensation to dairy farmers. Theo himself, who is described as bullish, has been pushing many lawsuits against his critics, such as Greenpeace. In November 2015, the use of a half-naked, dark-skinned pinup model on milk bottles in Germany and Austria provoked accusations of sexism and racism.

In July 2015, a Superior Court judge in Orange County, California ruled in favor of Olenicoff in a suit brought by his former bank, UBS AG. The judge dismissed the Swiss bank's claims of malicious prosecution by Olenicoff and his Olen Properties, saying in essence that UBS itself was too dirty to sue. Olenicoff has been in dispute with UBS since 2007, when he pleaded guilty to a felony tax charge for lying about stashing more than $350 million offshore (in Europe). He paid $52 million in back taxes and was sentenced to 2 years of probation and 120 hours of community service.

It's a rare disappointment in an otherwise legendary career. After failing to get into USC film school, Spielberg got his start as an unpaid intern in the editing department of Universal. Today, a slice of the cash from every ticket at Universal theme parks goes directly into Spielberg's pocket thanks to blockbuster hits like 'E.T.' and 'Jaws'.

In the fall of 2016, she shot back-to-back roles in the biopic 'The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks' and 'A Wrinkle In Time,' an adaptation of the fantasy novel. Ratings at the Oprah Winfrey Network continue to climb. The 2016 premiere of megachurch drama 'Greenleaf' was the network's most-watched debut, with 3.04 million viewers. She purchased a 10% stake Weight Watchers in October 2015; its stock plunged after an initial surge, resulting in its CEO leaving in September 2016. Winfrey is helping to find a replacement. The media mogul overcame a tough childhood: raised on a farm without indoor plumbing, she survived serial abuse and rape, and became a mother as a teen. Her son died in infancy. Her way out came in the form of a federal program that gained her access to a rich suburban school.

Yvonne's father, Heinz Heinrich Bauer, began the company's international expansion with the 1981 launch of the first weekly women's magazine in the U.S., Woman's World. (Other Bauer titles include In Touch and First for Women.) Today, Bauer -- Europe's largest magazine publisher, focused primarily on a female demographic -- has a presence in more than 20 countries, with approximately 10,000 employees and annual revenues exceeding $2.4 billion, approximately two-thirds of which are derived from markets outside of Germany. Yvonne Bauer studied German philology at the University of Bamberg and went on to apprentice at the publishing house Hoffmann und Campe, before starting her career at Bauer in 2005. She took the reins in 2010, after her father transferred 85% of the business to her. She is the second-youngest of four daughters: sisters Mirja, Nicola and Saskia also work at Bauer, with each owning 5% of the group. Although ""We think popular"" is the company's tag line, reflecting its passion for interpreting popular culture, Yvonne can be outspoken on weighty issues such as press freedom. ""To preserve this freedom and ensure that we will remain free to choose what we want to read in the future,"" she declared in a note on Bauer Media Group's home page, ""we will have to interact with one another in a tolerant and open-minded fashion. By endorsing this campaign in our magazines, we are putting down a clear marker in support of freedom of the press and freedom of expression.""

The following year they formed a partnership with the Haniel family and the late billionaire Otto Beisheim to propagate Metro Cash & Carry -- a chain of self-service wholesale markets. Metro AG went public in 1996, and the international colossus known today as Metro Group, with revenue in excess of $60 billion, includes wholesale cash & carry (Metro), food retailing (Real) and consumer electronics (Media-Saturn). Metro Group employs approximately 203,000 people in about 30 countries. Neither Michael or Rainer Schmidt-Ruthenbeck is involved in the management of the company.

1077,Billionaires,2017,3,rosely-schweizer,"The Oetker fortune -- of which Rosely Schweizer is one of eight billionaire beneficiaries -- was built on baking and pudding powder. Now broadly diversified, Dr August Oetker KG -- a holding company whose subsidiaries employ some 26,000 people and generate around $15 billion in annual revenue -- traces its roots to 1891, when August Oetker, a pharmacist, started selling non-perishable baking powder. After World War II, his grandson Rudolf August Oetker, a former Nazi SS officer, quickly rose to prominence as the driving force behind one of Germany's most recognizable brands. In 1950, according to the family history ""Die Oetkers,"" Oetker produced more than 750 million packages of baking and pudding powder. Personifying Germany's Wirtschaftswunder, or economic miracle, he developed additional food products and expanded into beverages, container shipping, financial services and luxury hotels. He died in 2007, at age 90, leaving eight children from three marriages. The heirs, who along with their families each own 12.5% percent of the conglomerate, have disagreed over the management and future direction of Oetker, however. Split into two camps, the rivalry is between the children from Rudolf August's first two marriages -- Rosely Schweizer and Bergit Graefin Douglas, plus Richard, Christian and August Oetker -- and the siblings from the third marriage: Alfred, Carl Ferdinand and Julia Oetker. Alfred was expected to take over as general partner from his half-brother August in 2010, but he was blocked by the older siblings, who instead crowned Richard Oetker. In January 2015, with a proxy fight pending before an arbitration tribunal, the groups agreed to recruit an outside CEO when Richard retires in 2017. Rosely Schweizer studied economics in Innsbruck, Austria, worked at the family's sparkling wine and spirits company Henkell & Soehnlein, and served as the conglomerate's advisory board chairwoman until 2010. She's also been been active in politics for Germany's Christian Democratic Union.

(He still owns the remaining 50.1%). Burda's portfolio now consists of 540 media products worldwide, including the German editions of Elle, InStyle and Playboy. Though built via mass-market print publications -- the German newsweekly Focus and the celebrity magazine Bunte are company mainstays -- digital sources now account for fully half of Burda's roughly $2.2 billion in annual revenue. A big success in both print and digital is BurdaStyle, a portfolio of media brands aimed at women. (BurdaStyle has been publishing Harper's Bazaar in Germany since August 2013, in a joint venture with U.S. media company Hearst.)  In March 2014, Burda entered into a joint venture with F+W, a New York City-based content and e-commerce company, to run the BurdaStyle brand in the U.S. and Canada, as well as the U.K. digital activities of BurdaStyle.

1394,Billionaires,2017,3,david-einhorn,"Bio
- David Einhorn is one of Wall Street's most closely watched investors due to his bold investment calls, both long and short.

- Einhorn heads hedge fund Greenlight Capital, which has $7 billion in assets and has posted a 15.4% net return since inception in May 1996.

- In the financial crisis, he famously questioned Lehman Brothers' books, arguing that the investment bank was being evasive about its risks.

- Einhorn's funds have had mixed results in recent years, missing most of the stock market's rally. Notably, he continues to lose money pressing bets against Amazon, Tesla and Netflix as part of a ""bubble basket"" of internet stocks. Recent investment Twitter has surged since Einhorn took a position in late 2017.

- Through the Einhorn Family Charitable Trust supports educational causes like Teach For America and City Year.

DID YOU KNOW?

- Mired in one of Wall Street's most brutal slumps, Ackman's $8.8 billion hedge fund has underperformed the S&P 500 by 20% for three straight years.

- After his first fund, Gotham Partners, Ackman created Pershing Square in 2004 and rose to fame for his short of bond insurer MBIA and his rescue of mall operator General Growth.

- Coming out of the crisis, he at times topped Wall Street due to activist wins like Canadian Pacific, Fortune Brands and Allergan.

- Controversial investments like a short of Herbalife yielded a battle with billionaire Carl Icahn, while his orchestration of a merger bid between Valeant Pharmaceuticals of Allergan drew allegations of insider trading (and a $290 million settlement).

- An over $3 billion bet on Valeant has proven the most costly, and turnaround investments in Chipotle and ADP have so far yielded mixed results.

- Ackman is an avid tennis player and philanthropist.

While working as an assistant designer to Giorgio Correggiari, he met Stefano Gabbana at a club, and eventually got Gabbana a job with Correggiari and became a sort of mentor. By 1983, the pair left Correggiari and were living together in Milan and in a relationship, working on freelance designs until they founded Dolce & Gabbana in 1985. The following year, they made their runway debut at the Milan Fashion Week. Known for their extravagant style and animal print designs, their big breakthrough came in 1993 when Madonna selected them to design costumes for her Girlie tour, exposing them to the masses.

In 2010, Steinmetz sold 51% of the mining rights to Brazilian multinational Vale for $2.5 billion, but as of February 2016 he had only collected $500 million. Rio Tinto sued BSGR in New York but the case was thrown out in November 2015.
