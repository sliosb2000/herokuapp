That month the company announced it was moving its headquarters from Luxembourg to Switzerland, citing the complexity and ""uncertainty"" of the European Union. Dixon founded the company in Brussels in 1989, long before a new generation of competitors, such as WeWork, came on the scene. IWG, which calls itself a ""flexible workspace provider,"" rents out meeting rooms, office space by the hour, virtual offices and space in co-working sites; it has nearly 3,000 locations in 106 countries, serving 2.3 million customers. Dixon owns about one-third of the company, which trades on the London Stock Exchange. The son of a car mechanic, Dixon dropped out of school at age 16 to start a business delivering sandwiches by bicycle. Later he launched a service in London delivering hot dogs and hamburgers in vans. Realizing that it was hard to procure buns, he launched a company that supplied bread rolls to food vendors, then sold it in 1988 for the equivalent of $1.4 million.
