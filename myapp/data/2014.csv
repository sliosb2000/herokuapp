After years focused on his philanthropy, Gates plans to spend more of his time working with product managers at Microsoft as rivals like Google and Apple continue to outshine the company in the market. Gates stepped down as Microsoft chairman in February, when new CEO Satya Nadella took over. Meanwhile, Gates remains focused on his foundation's efforts to eradicate polio (he secured $335 million in pledges to the cause from six billionaire comrades, including $100 million each from Mexico's Carlos Slim and former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg) and getting fellow billionaires more involved with philanthropy.

Though publicly traded, $40 billion (sales) LVMH has long been a family affair.

Today his two older children, Delphine and Antoine, are intimately involved in expanding his vision. In December 2013 he appointed Antoine chairman of luxury Italian knits company, Loro Piana, in which LVMH purchased an 80% stake for $2.6 billion in July 2013. Antoine also runs shoemaker Berluti, which he is expanding into ready-to-wear and other men's luxury categories.

In fact, all of his tech bets, whether in Spotify, Siri, or more recently Bitcoin payment service provider, BitPay, benefit the foundation, not him. Still his stakes in Hutchinson Whampoa, Cheung Kong and Husky Energy, plus rich dividends of $1.7 billion in just the past two years, allow him to hold onto the top spot in his region. Born in Chaozhou in China's Guangdong Province, Li and his family had to flee to Hong Kong during the Sino-Japanese war. Not long after their arrival Li's father, who had been a primary school principal in China, died from tuberculosis. At age 12 he quit school and started as an apprentice in a watch-strap factory. By 14 he was working full-time in a plastics trading company to help support his family. In 1950 Li quit to start his own business making plastic toys and everyday items.

Holdings include stakes in News Corp, Citigroup, hotel management companies Four Seasons Hotels & Resorts, Movenpick Hotels & Resorts and Fairmont Raffles Holding, as well as hotel real estate such as the swanky Hotel George V in Paris and a stake in the Savoy Hotel in London. In 2012, the Prince and his investment company bought $300 million worth of Twitter shares; they're now worth upwards of $1 billion. Kingdom Holding could also benefit from a $125 million investment it made in Chinese e-commerce company JD.com, which filed to raise $1.5 billion in an IPO in January. He also owns extensive Saudi real estate and other assets outside of Kingdom Holding. In 2013, Prince Alwaleed sued Forbes for libel in response to an article about him.

Amid falling output from his Reliance Industries' KG-D6 offshore oilfield, the government finally approved the doubling of the nation's gas prices, effective April. This decision, which his oil giant and its partner BP had long lobbied for, once again sparked allegations it had deliberately suppressed output and hoarded gas. The company has denied wrongdoing but faces a criminal investigation instigated by anti-graft crusader Arvind Kejriwal, founder of the Common Man's Party who recently alleged that Ambani is ""running the government"". Ambani is contemplating suing him for defamation.

Werner's son Michael, who heads the supervisory board, retired as chief executive in 2007 after 26 years in that position. (An environmentalist, he supports a foundation that funds the preservation of Germany's Elbe river.) In October, his son Benjamin joined the Otto Group in an e-commerce capacity. Michael's brother Alexander manages the family's ECE Group, which develops and manages shopping centers (at last count, 189 were under management). It also develops and builds transport complexes, logistics centers, company headquarters, office complexes, industrial buildings and special-purpose properties. With an estimated value of $9 billion, ECE represents about half of the family's fortune. Then there's Paramount Investment Group, an asset manager for closed-end funds that own 18 prime office properties in New York City, Washington D.C. and San Francisco, representing a total of 14.25 million square feet of space. Estimated value of the Ottos' stake: $2 billion. Another family entity manages roughly 8,300 apartments and 1.5 million square feet of industrial space in the Toronto area. Rounding out the portfolio are retail and service businesses, including the world's largest mail-order company, under the umbrella of Otto GmbH & Co.

Since it started in 2010, three of Vekselberg's companies got grants from the Skolkovo Fund. The largest of those grants, $13 million, was awarded to a Vekselberg company called Hevel, which is developing thin-film energy technologies. In 2013, together with Mikhail Fridman and Leonard Blavatnik, he sold a 50% stake in joint oil venture TNK-BP to state-owned Rosneft for $28 billion. Vekselberg got $7 billion. He spent a chunk of the cash to buy 25% of Swiss steel company Schmolz+Bickenbach. His Renova conglomerate is a strategic investor in Swiss companies. The biggest of them are high tech industrial group Oerlikon and Sulzer, an industrial engineering firm. Born in the Ukraine, he made his first million selling scrap copper from worn out cables. In the 1990s he started holding company SUAL. In 2007 SUAL merged with aluminum maker Rusal and miner Glencore to create the world's largest aluminum producer, UC Rusal, in which he still has a stake. A consummate dealmaker, he also has interests in chemicals, utilities and telecoms. He owns a big art collection, including nine Faberge eggs he bought from the Forbes family for $100 million. In November 2013 in St. Petersburg Vekselberg opened a private museum to exhibit his Faberge collection and other pieces of Russian art. In February 2014 he announced he will give a three-room apartment in his Azimut Hotel in Sochi to pair skaters Tatiana Volosozhar and Maxim Trankov, who won the gold medal in the winter Olympic games.

But the last two years have been a challenging time for Dalio. His All Weather fund was down by about 4% in 2013, even though its risk-parity strategy is supposed to make money in the market most of the time. Bridgewater's big Pure Alpha hedge fund was up in 2013 by about 5%. It was up by less than 1% in 2012, underperforming both the average hedge fund and the U.S. stock market for two straight years. But the recent underperformance has not diminished Bridgewater's popularity or esteem with the investment community. Dalio founded Bridgewater in his Manhattan apartment in 1975.

In 2008, the company announced a $15-billion, debt-financed takeover of publicly traded tire and auto parts giant Continental AG. For a while, in the wake of the ensuing worldwide financial crisis, it looked as if the high-wire act might all come crashing down. Continental's sales and share price plummeted, forcing the Schaefflers into debt-restructuring negotiations with their creditor banks. When the dust settled, after a Continental rights offering to raise capital and a round of debt refinancing, Schaeffler Group owned 49.9% of Continental. Since then, as the auto market has rebounded, the Schaefflers have continued to pay down debt via Continental share sales and excess cash flow. Since bottoming out in February 2009, Continental's share price has risen by more than 14-fold. Schaeffler Group now owns 36% of the company, a stake worth around $16 billion. Maria-Elisabeth took the helm of Schaeffler Group following the death of her husband, also named Georg, in 1996. Along with his brother Wilhelm (d. 1981), he founded the company in 1946, first making wooden spoons, clothespins and rakes. Son Georg, who practiced international business law in Dallas, has been at his mother's side helping to run the business since 2009.

His stakes in the group's two most important companies, Samsung Electronics and Samsung Life Insurance, have made him Korea's wealthiest individual. Under his leadership, Samsung Electronics has become one world's most recognized, high-quality electronics brands. It's the leading maker of smartphones, thanks to its flagship Galaxy model. Shipments have recently slowed, however, as the market anxiously awaits the introduction this spring of the new Galaxy S5, which will be paired with a new wearable device with advanced functions -- a successor to the Galaxy Gear smartwatch -- and may also include eye scanner (iris recognition) technology. The smartphone slowdown has taken a bite out of Lee's fortune, as shares of Samsung Electronics, also a leading producer of flat-screen TVs and memory chips, have fallen about 17% from their all-time high in January 2013. Meanwhile, Lee has claimed a major legal victory in an inheritance dispute with his estranged brother Lee Maeng-hee, the eldest son of Samsung founder Lee Byung-chu, who died in 1987. In February, a court rejected Lee Maeng-hee's appeal of an earlier decision denying his claim to about $850 million in stakes of Samsung Group companies. The court ruled that the 10-year period for inheritance claims had expired. Chairman Lee is an avid equestrian and also likes cars and classical music.

He also paid $95 million for Donald Trump's Palm Beach mansion, $150 million for two Greek islands that once belonged to Athina Onassis and $20 million for a Hawaiian island owned by actor Will Smith. Rybolovlev got his start in business with his scientist father in 1990 after studying medicine at the Perm Medical Institute. In 1992 he opened an investment fund and, like other future tycoons, began buying shares of industrial enterprises. He consolidated his shares into a controlling stake and in 1995 was named chairman of the board of Uralkali, Russia's largest producer of potassium fertilizers, founded in the 1930s.

151,Billionaires,2014,3,ludwig-merckle,"After the death of Adolf Merckle in 2009, at age 74, his son Ludwig took the helm of an empire mired in crisis and debt. The downward spiral had come about unexpectedly, after secretive Adolf -- once one of Germany's wealthiest men -- took a hit due to the 2008 financial crisis. He had taken out a loan to recapitalize HeidelbergCement, and used shares he owned in the cement company as collateral. When Heidelberg stock lost 75% of its value, the banks demanded early repayment of the loan. In the wake of this, Adolph committed suicide. Ludwig has since restructured the group and executed an impressive turnaround. In the fall of 2009, he unloaded shares of HeidelbergCement, cutting his stake from 74% to 25%. The following year, he sold generic drug maker Ratiopharm to Teva Pharmaceuticals for $5 billion. It looked as if Phoenix Group might have to go on the block as well, given the extent of the liabilities Adolf had assumed in assembling the drug wholesaler through acquisitions, but the company was saved when banks came through with an Eu 2.6 billion syndicated loan facility. Now Phoenix is deleveraging and on the rebound. Shares of HeidelbergCement, meanwhile, have risen in value. Rounding out Ludwig's portfolio: a 93% stake in snowcat maker Kaessbohrer and 50% of engine manufacturer Zollern. (Both companies are privately owned.) Ludwig Merckle once said that he wished to maintain as much as possible of his father's ""achievements."" He's already done an admirable job, and may yet get some additional satisfaction from a pending lawsuit filed by Merckle Group against Porsche for alleged malfeasance in its attempted takeover of Volkswagen.

In the past four years, they've invested $115 million in their Humanity United foundation, which funds 85 antislavery nonprofits as well as on-the-ground projects in five countries, including their first in Nepal. They've pledged to spend another $50 million by 2016. Born in France of Iranian parents, Omidyar moved to the U.S. with his family at age 6.

The dispute drove down the value of all Russian fertilizer companies. In August 2013 Belarusian authorities arrested Uralkali's CEO, saying he abused his power and embezzled funds while his company was involved in a trading alliance with Belaruskali, a fertilizer company owned by the Belarusian government. Together the companies controlled 40% of the global market for the fertilizer additive. The Belarusian government said Uralkali and Belaruskali could resume their relationship if Kerimov sold his stake. Billionaire Mikhail Prokhorov together with billionaire Dmitry Mazepin, an owner of mineral fertilizer company Uralchem, agreed to buy it. That put to rest talk by Belarus that it intended to arrest Kerimov, who also wound up selling his stake in Russia's largest real estate and homebuilding company, PIK Group, and slashing funding to his soccer team, Anzhi Makhachkala, selling off its star players. Kerimov made a career of investing in distressed companies. Back in 2008 he sold nearly all his Russian assets, including shares in Gazprom, government-owned Sberbank and a massive housing development in suburban Moscow just before Russia's financial meltdown. He borrowed heavily to buy stakes in Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, Deutsche Bank, Credit Suisse and others. He lost billions soon after. But he recovered and, with the help of loans from Russia's VTB bank, began investing again in the Russian market, buying a stake in the nation's largest gold mining outfit, Polyus Gold, in PIK and in leading long-distance telephony provider Rostelecom (he sold his Rostelecom stake in 2012). In the summer of 2010 he bought billionaire Dmitry Rybolovlev's stake in Uralkali. In exchange he gave Rybolovlev a portion of his stake in Polyus Gold. Kerimov is a native of Dagestan, a republic in Russia's North Caucasus. He represents Dagestan in the Federation Council, the upper house of Russia's parliament.

The founder of Hilcorp reportedly refused to open the shop until he was convinced they had the best donuts in town (they are pretty good). Back in the oilfields, Hilcorp is busy investing hundreds of millions a year in Alaska's Cook Inlet. He's also big in the Utica shale of Ohio and the Gulf Coast region. In 2012 Hilcorp sold its Gulf of Mexico fields for $550 million. Hildebrand's biggest payday came in 2011, when he turned a $100 million investment in the Eagle Ford shale into $1.4 billion with a sale to Marathon Oil. Hildebrand left a petroleum engineering job at ExxonMobil in 1989 and joined with partners to start buying up proven oilfields that were too small for the supermajors -- then applying new technology to squeeze out profits.

In 2008, the company announced a $15-billion, debt-financed takeover of publicly traded tire and auto parts giant Continental AG. For a while, in the wake of the ensuing worldwide financial crisis, it looked as if the high-wire act might all come crashing down. Continental's sales and share price plummeted, forcing the Schaefflers into debt-restructuring negotiations with their creditor banks. When the dust settled, after a Continental rights offering to raise capital and a round of debt refinancing, Schaeffler Group owned 49.9% of Continental. Since then, as the auto market has rebounded, the Schaefflers have continued to pay down debt via Continental share sales and excess cash flow. Since bottoming out in February 2009, Continental's share price has risen by more than 14-fold. Schaeffler Group now owns 36% of the company, a stake worth around $16 billion.

In 1962 he founded Electronic Data Systems and ushered in the computer age building government and corporate I.T. systems. Perot made $1.5 billion selling EDS to G.M., then turned around and created Perot Systems. Dell bought that company for $3.9 billion in 2009. Along the way Perot helped his son Ross, Jr. start up Hillwood Development, which built the 18,000-acre AllianceTexas project in Fort Worth. All the while Perot was dedicated to the plight of POW/MIAs, repeatedly traveling to Vietnam during the war. In 1978 he recruited military vets on a mission to rescue two EDS employees imprisoned in Iran -- a saga recounted in Ken Follett's ""On Wings of Eagles."" A few years ago a U.S. special forces team presented Perot with a walking stick. Recovered from Tora Bora, Afghanistan in the days following 9-11, it is said to have belonged to Osama Bin Laden.

The $60,000 sedan, due to arrive in select dealerships in March, will be the first luxury car the company has sold in the U.S. In terms of wealth, the holding that makes Chung a billionaire is a 32% interest in publicly traded Hyundai Glovis Co., which functions as a holding company for stakes in Hyundai affiliates while also providing logistics services to those affiliates and other clients.

After graduation, he gained managerial experience working for a marketer of mineral oil and chemicals.

He sold more than two-thirds of his stake in Pao de Acucar (also known as CBD) during 2013; he now owns just under 4%. His net worth has fallen an estimated $700 million over the past year due to capital gains taxes and a weaker Brazilian currency. While in charge of Pao de Acucar, his relationship with Casino was belligerent. At 77 he still wants to run a huge company and in April 2013 was named chairman of meat processor Brasil Foods (BRF). BRF has 114,000 employees and is also one of Grupo Pao de Acucar's largest suppliers, which resulted in Casino forcing Diniz off the retailer's board in order to avoid a conflict of interest. Diniz is expected to help BRF increase its presence internationally; antitrust restrictions have hampered the company's potential in Brazil.

A celebrity in his own right, he oversees a company that publishes more than 300 magazines worldwide, including the German editions of Elle, InStyle and Playboy. Though he built Hubert Burda Media via mass-market print publications -- the German newsweekly Focus and the celebrity magazine Bunte are company mainstays -- digital sources now account for fully half of revenue. A big success in the digital realm is BurdaStyle.com -- the largest online DIY fashion and sewing community, with more than 800,000 registered active members and nearly seven million monthly page views. In April 2013, Hubert Burda Media and F+W Media Inc., which caters to craft and hobby communities, entered into a multi-faceted licensing deal for marketing the Burda Style brand and BurdaStyle.com in the U.S. and Canada. Other companies in the Burda digital portfolio include Holidaycheck, Elitepartners, Zooplus and Xing -- the German equivalent of the U.S. professional networking website LinkedIn. In 2010, Hubert Burda handed over day-to-day control of his company to Paul-Bernhard Kallen, a former McKinsey & Co. consultant and chief financial officer, and subsequently transferred a 40% ownership stake to his two children, Jacob and Elisabeth, who are in their twenties. (He still owns the remaining 60%). Among his philanthropic endeavors is the Felix Burda Foundation, which is committed to reducing the number of deaths from colon cancer in Germany (it's named after his son Felix, who died of colon cancer in 2001, at age 33). He also supports The Bambi, aka the Bambi Awards, which recognize excellence in international media and television; the Hermann-Lenz-Prize, a German literary award; the Burda Center for Innovative Communication, a media center at Ben Gurion University in Israel; and the Burda Academy of the Third Millennium, an interdisciplinary forum for researchers and thinkers.",687,billionaires,2500.0,Media & Entertainment,0,54.0,"{'name': 'Hubert Burda', 'uri': 'hubert-burda', 'imageExists': True, 'squareImage': '//specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/5e762819c7b02d000666c83b/416x416.jpg?background=000000&cropX1=390&cropX2=2935&cropY1=10&cropY2=2554'}",True,Hubert Burda,74.0,Germany,,Munich,publishing,['Media & Entertainment'],Germany,,1491252175716,29,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,faris/5/2014/4344,691,True,200.0,8.695652173913032,False,U,M,-943383600000.0,125.0,Burda,Hubert,The World's Billionaires,,,http://onforb.es/1IR6Yer,,http://onforb.es/1IR71XC,1393822800000,False,False,http://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/5e762819c7b02d000666c83b/280x425.jpg?fit=scale&background=000000,//specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/5e762819c7b02d000666c83b/416x416.jpg?background=000000&cropX1=390&cropX2=2935&cropY1=10&cropY2=2554,False,641.0,"['rank', 'finalWorth', 'personName', 'bios', 'bio']",False,,,,,,,,,,,,

Gertler disputes these claims, and in December 2013, his company, Gibralter-based Fleurette, joined the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative to stave off further criticism. His ties to at least one regime seem fairly transparent. He bought his first mine in the tumultuous Democratic Republic of Congo in 1997 and soon became friends with Joseph Kabila, who then ran the military and is now the DRC's president.  Fleurette companies are among the country's largest taxpayers, according to Gertler representatives, paying $370 million in 2012. They are also collectively its largest private employer, with 30,000 Congolese on staff. Fleurette and the Gertler Family Foundation are together developing 1,482 acres of land into a kibbutz-style farm to address the DRC's food security issues. It expects to produce more than 4,500 tons of carrots, tomatoes, onions, potatoes, and other vegetables in 2014. Mining is in Gertler's blood.

It collected over 20% of votes in a parliamentary election last fall, resonating with those tired of corruption charges against the former regime.

He also recently told Oprah it's okay for men to cry -- even CEOs. Schultz has also been busy introducing new products to stimulate the Starbucks brand, including testing out ""homemade"" sodas and partnering with French yogurt maker Danone to offer a new Greek yogurt brand to customers. Schultz continues to grow the company globally, opening its first stores in Vietnam and India in the past year and announcing plans to enter Myanmar in the near future. So far, investors are happily guzzling the new strategies Schultz is serving. Starbucks' shares jumped more than 30% in the past year, increasing Schultz' stock-heavy fortune. Through venture capital firm Maveron, Schultz is also an investor in consumer businesses such as Pinkberry frozen yogurt, Lululemon activewear, eBay and Groupon. Schultz was raised in housing projects in Brooklyn, N.Y., and went to study and play football at Northern Michigan U. He later moved back to New York to sell kitchen equipment and housewares for a Swedish company before landing a marketing gig at a small coffee bean store called Starbucks. He traveled to Italy and was inspired to open an espresso bar in the U.S. His Starbucks bosses said no, so he started a rival store in 1985, making his java with Starbucks beans. He bought Starbucks from his bosses two years later for $3.8 million and took it public in 1992.

Lennon bought Cullen out of his stake in Swagelok (then The Crawford Fitting Company) for $2,000 in the 1940s and transformed it into a billion-dollar enterprise by the 1990s. But the question of succession remained publicly unanswered when Lennon died in 1998. Had everything gone according to plan, who inherited the fortune would still remain a mystery. After all, Lennon's motto was ""Secrecy is success, success is secrecy."" But the entrepreneur confounded his own plans when he gave John Lennon, his son, only $25 million and each of his grandchildren $50,000 while passing on the lions' share of the estate to Lozick. That drew a 2002 lawsuit by John's son William against Lozick and her trustees (and obtained by Forbes) that exposed the inner workings of the family's  financials. William sought to block a complex trust arrangement that had Lozick inheriting the entire estate 21 years after her father's death. The language of the trust stipulated that the trustees could award the trust's assets to Lozick at any time prior to that 21 years, but also noted that if she were to die before they did, the fortune would go to Lennon's grandkids. Catherine settled with her nephew, agreeing to pay each grandchild an additional $1.25 million, and the trustees noted in court documents that the trust's assets were distributed to Lozick in April 2003, making her the new (perhaps even more secretive) billionaire majority-owner of her father's company.",869,billionaires,2000.0,Manufacturing,0,301.0,"{'name': 'Catherine Lozick', 'uri': 'catherine-lozick', 'imageExists': False}",True,Catherine Lozick,69.0,United States,Florida,Naples,Manufacturing,['Manufacturing'],United States,,1491252096196,2,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,faris/5/2014/194251,897,False,,,False,N,F,-788904000000.0,225.0,Lozick,Catherine,The World's Billionaires,,,http://onforb.es/1IR6Yer,,http://onforb.es/1IR71XC,1393822800000,False,False,,,False,,"['rank', 'finalWorth', 'personName', 'bios', 'bio']",False,,,South,"Naples, FL",1.0,,,,,,,

A chance meeting with New York developer Stephen Ross (also a Forbes 400 member) led to a partnership; the 2 cofounded Related Group of Florida (Ross, of Related Cos., is a minority partner) in 1979. They built affordable housing in the 1980s, then switched to high-end condo construction. In 2011 Perez, an avid collector of Latin American art, sparked controversy when the Miami Art Museum agreed to rename itself the Jorge M.

The son of Armenian immigrants, he first delved into the textiles industry, and then the cable TV business in the 1980s.  He added to his media portfolio, buying four radio stations, newspapers, and a TV channel by the end of the decade.  In the 1990s he offloaded all of his media holdings, netting $750 million with the sale of Cablevision, as a wave of privatization brought capital into Argentina.  Toward the end of the '90s he hit his first jackpot leading a consortium to secure a 30-year concession to build and operate Argentina's airports.  Today he has a portfolio of 51 airports with annual revenues that exceed $1.2 billion, including the first privately operated airports in Brazil.  After Argentina's economic crash in late 2001, he bought assets through his Corporacion America holding company, which now owns more than 260,000 acres of land dedicated to crops, cattle, and vineyards.  Corporacion America also owns an infrastructure development company, an oil and gas producer, a chip factory called Unitech Blue (in which Eurnekian has already invested $250 million), a biodiesel production facility, and land in Armenia used for fruit production and wine.  In 2011 he sold 21 duty free shops in Argentina, Uruguay, Ecuador, Martinique, and Armenia to Switzerland's Dufry AG for $957 million. He has never married and has no children.

He made a timely sale of a sizable portion of his coal operation to Russian mining and steel company Mechel OAO for $436 million in cash and approximately $240 million worth of Mechel preferred shares in 2009 before the industry began to tank. But those shares dropped more than 75% in the past year, and Justice's remaining coal operations have struggled: idled plants, layoffs and lawsuits from nearly a dozen companies claiming Justice's businesses haven't been paying their bills. But with cash from the sale to Mechel, the West Virginia native switched his focus from coal to tourism just at the right time, plugging $400 million into buying up and renovating hotels and resorts. That includes the iconic the Greenbrier Resort, which was hemorrhaging money before Justice gave it a makeover and began hosting events including the PGA Tour, poker and blackjack tournaments and a tennis match between legends John McEnroe and Pete Sampras. He's also building a state-of-the-art medical research and education facility on the hotel grounds for a reported $250 million. He recently announced he was testing the market to sell his Wintergreen Resort, a separate 11,000-acre estate. Justice received his bachelor's and M.B.A from Marshall University before joining his father's coal mining firm Bluestone Industries in 1976. He started Bluestone Farms the next year as a subsidiary of the family business; it eventually became the largest grain producer on the east coast. After his father passed away in 1993, Justice took over and expanded the company rapidly by acquiring coal deposits and additional farmland. Justice is also a celebrated high school basketball coach, receiving the West Virginia girls' basketball Coach of the Year award for 2012. A former boy scout, Justice donated $25 million to the Boy Scouts of America in 2011 to fund the construction of a 10,600-acre reserve near his West Virginia home.

He left in 2004 to start Khosla Ventures. Khosla dislikes how VCs see startups as ""deals,"" rather than as people. ""I call myself a venture assistant,"" he says.

Korea's second-largest maker of smartphones behind Samsung, LG, which has been losing market share to Chinese producers such as Huawei Technologies Co. and Lenovo Group Ltd., is deemphasizing lower-priced models in favor of the high-end G series, including the 5.2-inch G2 and the 6-inch G Flex with a curved display, both of which run on 4G networks. Meanwhile, LG -- hoping to revive shrinking global demand and stagnating prices for flat-screen TVs -- plans to roll out 12 new models with ultra-high-definition display technology this year. It also has announced the first television with a flexible screen using so-called ?organic? LED technology, which makes possible a thinner screen and brighter picture compared to liquid crystal display screens. (Samsung also is introducing a set with a bendable screen that adjusts to viewing angles.) An even bigger initiative for LG Group is green energy (investments will reach $7 billion by 2015).

Perez Companc, an avid car collector, started out working in the family banking group, Banco Rio, only to buyout his family in the early 1990s.  By 1997, he sold it to Spanish banking giant Santander.  During the 1990s, a wave of privatizations allowed Perez Companc to claim stakes in all sorts of businesses, from telecommunications and public utilities to railroads and shopping malls.  In 1990 he invested $400 million for a 60% stake in Molinos Rio de La Plata, a diversified maker of pasta, flour, and frozen vegetables, which he has built into one of the major food producers and exporters of Argentina; in 2009, he transferred his 75% stake to his 7 living children.  Perez Companc also owns Goyaike, which holds more than 740,000 acres throughout Argentina used for wool production, crops, biotechnology, cattle, and milk production.  At the urging of his wife, Perez Companc founded Munchi's, a major ice cream chain in Argentina; he also built Bioparque Temaiken, a nature and wildlife preserve outside of Buenos Aires.  Intensely Catholic, Perez Companc also loves cars, having a notable collection of Ferraris including a 1962 Testa Rossa, a 2004 Formula One model used by Michael Schumacher, an Enzo, and a limited edition F50.

1225,Billionaires,2014,3,christopher-cline,"The American coal industry is in the doldrums, but there's one bright spot: Chris Cline and his Foresight Energy. As other coal miners go under, Foresight is rolling, with $130 million in 2012 net income on sales of 15 million tons of coal from brand-new mines boasting the lowest costs in the industry. He had planned to do an IPO of Foresight, but after a $1.5 billion debt refinancing in August 2013 he may not bother. He owns 60% of the company. In the 1990s, Cline -- the son of a coal miner and a former miner himself-- had the foresight to buy up coal reserves in the Illinois Basin, acquiring mines from the likes of U.S. Steel and Exxon. No one had wanted the coal after 1992 amendments to the Clean Air Act because it was high in sulfur content, and created lots of sulfur dioxide when burned for electricity. But Cline believed that innovations and pollution control technology would allow coal to make a comeback. Because the high-sulfur coal had been ignored for so long, the coal seams are thicker, not as deep underground, and thus easier (and cheaper) to mine. As a result his costs, at roughly $22 per ton, are significantly lower than the $50 per ton incurred at the average mine east of the Mississippi. For his next big venture, Cline has assembled vast reserves of iron ore in Michigan and hopes to open a mine there if he can get around unhappy environmentalists and native tribes. If that doesn't work out, Cline still has some other things going for him: a big yacht named Mine Games, a mansion in West Palm Beach, and (since late 2012) a budding romance with his neighbor Elin Nordegren, the ex-wife of Tiger Woods.",1210,billionaires,1400.0,Energy,0,395.0,"{'name': 'Christopher Cline', 'uri': 'christopher-cline', 'imageExists': True, 'squareImage': '//specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/59de7c1f31358e542c039f26/416x416.jpg?background=000000&cropX1=621&cropX2=1842&cropY1=330&cropY2=1551'}",True,Christopher Cline,56.0,United States,Florida,North Palm Beach,coal,['Energy'],United States,,1394743455559,15,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,faris/5/2014/13540,1226,True,200.0,16.66666666666667,True,U,M,-378673200000.0,225.0,Cline,Christopher,The World's Billionaires,,,http://onforb.es/1IR6Yer,http://onforb.es/1zwwhwN,http://onforb.es/1IR71XC,1393822800000,False,False,http://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/59de7c1f31358e542c039f26/280x425.jpg?fit=scale&background=000000,//specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/59de7c1f31358e542c039f26/416x416.jpg?background=000000&cropX1=621&cropX2=1842&cropY1=330&cropY2=1551,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Described by friends as a bit obsessive, Woodman worked 18-hour days in his bedroom with a CamelBak of Gatorade and water strapped to his back to prevent unnecessary trips to the kitchen. He released his first video camera, a 35-millimeter waterproof film version, in 2004 and went on to sell it everywhere from surf shops to home shopping network QVC. Today, the camera shoots video in cinema-quality HD, allowing anyone from professional surfer Kelly Slater to amateur snowboarders to capture their adventures. Revenues surpassed $500 million in 2012. Woodman maintains that GoPro has been profitable from day one. In Dec. 2012, Taiwan-based electronics manufacturer Foxconn (also known as Hon Hai, run by billionaire Terry Gou) made a $200 million investment in the company for an 8.88% stake.

After the venture failed, Dixon traveled, working odd jobs before returning to the U.K. and founding The Bread Roll Company (That business grew out of a struggle to find roll suppliers when he ran a fleet of burger vans.) He sold the company in 1988, moved to Brussels and founded Regus in 1989 to solve another problem: itinerant businesspeople forced to work in coffee shops. The company went public in 2000, but cratered during the dot-com bust. To survive, Dixon sold the U.K. arm, but wisely held onto the rest of Regus; today his public holdings in the company are worth more than $1 billion, putting him back in the billionaire ranks for the first time since 2001.

Irani leveraged his Middle Eastern connections to secure for Oxy big projects in Bahrain, Qatar, Oman and Libya, while also doubling down on big old fields in California and Texas. Irani fully retired at the end of 2013. Was he worth what Oxy paid him? Well, in the last decade of his time as CEO Irani delivered to shareholders an average 28% annual return.

Raised Catholic, he converted to evangelical Christianity in the early 1970s. In 1977 he founded his own denomination in Rio de Janeiro, the Universal Church of the Kingdom of God, which grew into one of the biggest, most controversial religions in Brazil. The sect follows ""prosperity theology,"" which holds that faith and commitment to a church are rewarded with wealth. In July 2013 he finalized the acquisition of a 49% stake in privately-held bank Banco Renner, whose interest rates are among the highest in Brazil. The transaction has raised eyebrows in Brazil in part because Brazil's central bank treated Macedo as a foreign investor since he is based in the U.S. The bulk of Macedo's fortune comes from his ownership of Rede Record, Brazil's second-largest broadcaster, which he acquired in 1990 from fellow billionaire Silvio Santos. It's not clear where he got the money to buy the company. Brazil's Public Ministry has probed the question for more than 10 years. Reports have suggested he used church funds. Macedo won't comment. He also owns W67CI, an Atlanta-based Telemundo affiliate. His 2012 biography, ""Nothing to Lose,"" sold 1.2 million copies in Brazil. A sequel, ""Nothing to Lose 2,"" is already a best-seller.
