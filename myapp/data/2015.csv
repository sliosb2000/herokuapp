20,Billionaires,2015,3,georg-schaeffler,"The stereotype of financially conservative Germans having an aversion to leverage doesn't apply to Maria-Elisabeth Schaeffler-Thumann and her only son, Georg Schaeffler. They're the proprietors of Schaeffler Group, which encompasses Schaeffler AG, one of the world's largest producers of ball bearings and machine components. In 2008, the company announced a $15-billion, debt-financed takeover of publicly traded tire and auto parts giant Continental AG. For a while, in the wake of the ensuing worldwide financial crisis, it looked as if the high-wire act might all come crashing down. Continental's sales and share price plummeted, forcing the Schaefflers into debt-restructuring negotiations with their creditor banks. When the dust settled, after a Continental rights offering to raise capital and a round of debt refinancing, the Schaefflers owned 49.9% of Continental. Since then, as the auto market has rebounded, they've continued to pay down debt via Continental share sales and excess cash flow. Since bottoming out in February 2009, Continental's share price has risen 18-fold. Through Schaeffler Group and its parent, Schaeffler Verwaltungs GmbH, Georg and Maria-Elisabeth now own 46% of Continental, a stake worth around $17 billion. Most of the increase in the Schaefflers' net worth is attributable to the continued spectacular success of Continental and a better understanding on the part of Forbes of the financial strength of Schaeffler Group, independent of Continental. The brothers Wilhelm and Georg Schaeffler (Maria-Elisabeth's husband), both holders of Ph.D. degrees, founded the manufacturer that became known as INA in Herzogenaurach, Germany, in 1946. Maria-Elisabeth took over the company in 1996 following the death of Georg (Wilhelm Schaeffler died in 1981). Her son (also named Georg) served two years in the German armed forces -- he was a lieutenant in the air force reserves -- and worked within Schaeffler Group from 1990 to 1996. Following his father's death, Georg studied law in the U.S and wound up practicing international business law in Dallas. He joined his mother in running Schaeffler Group in 2009, amid the turbulences caused by the Continental AG takeover. He is the head of the supervisory board of Schaeffler Group and a member of the supervisory board of Continental AG. Now the richest German, he owns 80% of umbrella company INA Holding Schaeffler GmbH & Co. KG and his mother, 20%.

Mordashov had relied on a $730 million loan from the U.S. Department of Energy to refurbish and expand the Dearborn operation, but the loan was revoked in 2012 in response to political pressure. Since 2004 he invested $3 billion in Columbus and Dearborn and then sold both plants in September 2014 for $2.3 billion. After that deal Severstal paid record dividends of $1 billion.

Through a holding company, he holds 53% of publicly traded Kuehne + Nagel International AG, which has 63,000 employees in more than 100 countries. Having stepped back as Chairman of the Executive Committee, he now serves as Honorary Chairman. In 2008, in an effort to keep the company anchored in Germany, Kuehne and a group of investors that included the city of Hamburg formed the Albert Ballin KG consortium to bid for 160-year-old container-ship operator Hapag-Lloyd AG. The company is merging with Chile's CSAV (Compania Sud Americana de Vapores SA) to form what is expected to be the world's fourth-biggest container shipper, in terms of capacity. The combined entity hopes to list shares on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange in 2015, following a capital increase. (Klaus-Michael Kuehne is expected to emerge with a 20% stake.) Kuehne currently divides his time between his home in Schindellegi, Switzerland; his chalet in the Swiss ski resort town of Lenzerheide; and a warm-weather hilltop residence facing the port of Andratx, on the Spanish island of Mallorca. Also a frequent visitor to his home town of Hamburg, he helps to fund and guide the city's soccer club Hamburger Sport-Verein, commonly known as HSV. In 2003, in partnership with the city of Hamburg and the Technical University of Hamburg, Kuehne founded the Hamburg School of Logistics, later renamed Kuehne Logistics University. The university is supported by a charitable foundation originally formed by Kuehne and his parents in 1976. In September 2013 Kuehne pledged $54 million to the university over the next 5 years.

Before going public in 2014, Cheil, which started out in 1954 as a manufacturer of textiles, merged with Everland and another affiliate, Samsung SDI, to create a 'eading producer of energy-storage solutions, including batteries for autos and consumer electronics, as well as speciality materials used in the manufacture of TVs, semiconductors and smartphones. (It also owns and manages resort and theme park projects, and provides a variety of business and hospitality services.) Lee and his heirs -- Jay Y. Lee and his sisters Lee Boo-Jin and Lee Seo-Hyun -- together own approximately 42% of Cheil, a stake worth around $7.7 billion. Samsung SDS, an IT provider for the construction and manufacturing industries, also completed its own IPO in 2014. Lee and his children now own 19% of SDS, a stake worth about $3.3 billion. Samsung meanwhile has been selling and reshuffling other affiliates, in part to comply with the government's drive to press family-run business groups (chaebol) to unwind cross-shareholdings and improve corporate governance and transparency. The Lee family faces the delicate task of balancing this agenda with the challenge of trying to maintain control of Samsung Group when it comes time to pay an inheritance tax bill that experts say could run $5 to $6 billion. Long regarded as Korea's premiere Alpha Capitalist, Lee Kun-Hee, no doubt, is doing everything in his power to ensure a smooth succession given his own experience in an inheritance dispute with his brother Lee Maeng-Hee, the eldest son of Samsung founder Lee Byung-Chul, who died in 1987. In February 2014, a court rejected Lee Maeng-hee's appeal of an earlier decision denying his claim to about $850 million in stakes of Samsung Group companies. The court ruled that the 10-year period for inheritance claims had expired. The two most important Samsung companies, other than Cheil, are Samsung Electronics and Samsung Insurance. Lee Kun-Hee's stakes in those two companies alone are worth around $10 billion. Jay Y. Lee, vice chairman of Samsung Electronics, has long been groomed as successor to his father. His sisters both hold the position of president at Cheil Industries. Lee Seo-Hyun heads the company's fashion division, while Lee Boo-Jin oversees resorts/theme parks and construction.",110,billionaires,11300.0,Diversified,0,1.0,"{'name': 'Lee Kun-Hee', 'uri': 'lee-kun-hee', 'imageExists': True, 'squareImage': '//specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/5e77b6abd8e1ae0007b7340a/416x416.jpg?background=000000&cropX1=65&cropX2=909&cropY1=57&cropY2=902'}",True,Lee Kun-Hee,73.0,South Korea,,Seoul,Samsung,['Diversified'],South Korea,Samsung Electronics,1491346837385,35,0.0,0.0,0.0,faris/5/2015/4583,111,True,200.0,1.8018018018018012,False,U,M,-882903600000.0,93.0,Lee,Kun-Hee,The World's Billionaires,Chairman,"{'name': 'Samsung Electronics', 'uri': 'companies/samsung-electronics', 'title': 'Chairman', 'totalEarningEst': False, 'salaryEst': False, 'government': False}",http://onforb.es/1IR6Yer,,http://onforb.es/1IR71XC,1425272400000,False,False,,102.0,http://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/5e77b6abd8e1ae0007b7340a/280x425.jpg?fit=scale&background=000000,,//specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/5e77b6abd8e1ae0007b7340a/416x416.jpg?background=000000&cropX1=65&cropX2=909&cropY1=57&cropY2=902,False,"['rank', 'finalWorth', 'personName', 'bios', 'bio']",False,,,,,,,,,,

Alberto built Menarini into one of Italy's leading drug companies, with 14 manufacturing sites around the world and more than 16,000 employees. Revenues in 2014 were $3.8 billion. Alberto Aleotti began working at Menarini in 1964, and pushed for international expansion during the 1970s and 80s. In the early 1990s, Aleotti bought Menarini from its owners. In 1992, his eldest daughter Lucia joined the company. As his health deteriorated in 2011, Aleotti handed over the reins of his empire to Lucia, who became chairman, and his son Alberto Giovanni, who became vice chairman. The Aleottis came under fire in 2010 when the Italian taxman accused them of tax evasion, initially seizing a reported $1.6 billion from the family, a move eventually annulled by the Italian Supreme Court in 2013. Yet the troubles didn't end there: after an initial settlement with tax authorities in 2011, Lucia, Alberto Giovanni, and mother Massimiliana were again accused of tax evasion by Italian authorities in 2013 to the tune of $160 million, which was added to a new investigation regarding the $1.6 billion that was previously returned.

Orphaned as a child, Abramovich dropped out of college, then made his fortune in a series of controversial oil export deals in the early 1990s. He teamed up with the late former billionaire Boris Berezovsky to take over Sibneft at a fraction of its market value. He sold his stake in Russian Aluminum to Deripaska in 2003, and a 73% stake in Sibneft to gas titan Gazprom for $13 billion in 2005. In August 2012 Abramovich won a suit in the High Court in London brought by Berezovsky who had been seeking $5.6 billion he claimed Abramovich failed to pay for stakes in Sibneft and Rusal. Abramovich owns the U.K.'s Chelsea soccer team and the world's largest yacht, the 533-foot Eclipse, which cost him almost $400 million in 2010.

He had purchased Grupo Iusacell, then Mexico's 4th largest wireless carrier, from Vodafone and Verizon in 2003 for $10 million and the assumption of some $800 million in debt. He sold half of Iusacell to billionaire Emilio Azcarraga's broadcaster Grupo Televisa in 2012. In September 2014, he bought back that 50% stake from Televisa, and then turned around and sold the whole company to AT&T for $2.5 billion, including $800 million in debt, in a deal that closed in January 2015. Forbes estimates that Salinas netted $835 million from the deal after taxes. Salinas kept a foot in the telecom industry by spinning off the entertainment and cable company TotalPlay from Iusacell as part of the transaction. That will allow him to continue offering services such as high-speed internet access and cable TV to high-end Mexican customers. The bulk of his fortune is still tied to his appliance retailer and banking company, Grupo Elektra, which targets less prosperous consumers who borrow money from his banking arm, Banco Azteca, to buy items like TVs and refrigerators at his Elektra stores.

172,Billionaires,2015,3,les-wexner,"Victoria's Secret boss Leslie Wexner has been a giant of the retail world for the last half century. He built up some of the most famous brands in the American mall, including Abercrombie & Fitch, Lane Bryant, Limited Too and Express. The son of a small store owner, he grew up in Columbus, Ohio. Watching his father work long hours for little reward he decided he never wanted to go into retail. But law school didn't interest him, so he dropped out and started helping out around his dad's store. A father-son argument led him to open his own store, which he named the Limited for the narrow selection of items it sold. He paid $1 million to buy Victoria's Secret in 1982 when it was a nearly-bankrupt chain of six shops.

188,Billionaires,2015,3,jay-y-lee,"The only son of Samsung Group Chairman Lee Kun-Hee, Jay Y. Lee has been groomed for years to take over Korea's biggest conglomerate, whose affiliates encompass everything from fashion, theme parks and insurance to advanced materials, IT services and smartphones and TVs. The succession issue came into sharper focus in May 2014, when his father suffered a heart attack and was hospitalized amidst a major restructuring of the family empire driven in part by the need to prepare for transferring control to the next generation. In 2013, the family's de facto holding company, unlisted Samsung Everland, took over the fashion division of Samsung affiliate Cheil Industries. Before going public in 2014, Cheil, which started out in 1954 as a textile manufacturer, merged with Everland and another affiliate, Samsung SDI, to create a leading producer of energy-storage solutions, including batteries for autos and consumer electronics, as well as speciality materials used in the manufacture of TVs, semiconductors and smartphones. (It also owns and manages resort and theme park projects, and provides a variety of business and hospitality services.) Jay Y. Lee's 23% stake in Cheil, worth around $4.2 billion, accounts for 58% of his estimated $7.2 billion fortune. Samsung SDS, an IT provider for the construction and manufacturing industries, also completed its own IPO in 2014. Jay Y.'s 11% stake in the company is worth about $1.9 billion. Samsung meanwhile has been selling and reshuffling other affiliates, in part to comply with the government's drive to press family-run business groups (chaebol) to unwind cross-shareholdings and improve corporate governance and transparency. The Lee family -- including Jay Y.'s billionaire sisters Lee Seo-Hyun and Lee Boo-Jin, both of whom hold the position of president at Cheil -- faces the delicate task of balancing this agenda with the challenge of trying to maintain control of Samsung Group when it comes time to pay an inheritance tax bill that experts say could run $5 to $6 billion. Close scrutiny is all but assured, considering that the means by which Jay Y. Lee originally acquired his holdings in Samsung affiliates like Everland and SDS raised concerns among watchdog groups and became the subject of a government investigation (no charges were filed). Jay Y. studied Asian history at Seoul National University in Korea and majored in business at Keio University in Japan. He also attended a doctoral program at Harvard Business School, focusing on e-commerce. Known for keeping low profile like his father, he attended memorial service for Steve Jobs on Oct. 7, 2011.

Lee) Suh Kyung-Bae has seen his net worth jump by approximately $4.4 billion from last year thanks to the soaring share prices of the cosmetics companies he runs -- holding company AmorePacific Group and its affiliate, AmorePacific Corp. The empire has been riding several powerful waves: public interest in environmentally friendly products formulated from natural ingredients; the rising purchasing power and mobility of Chinese consumers; and the ""K-beauty"" phenomenon -- the global interest in Korean beauty products and techniques, which is closely tied to the cultural trend known as Hallyu, or the Korean Wave, fueled by the surging popularity of Korean pop (""K-pop"") media content. Through duty-free promotions geared toward Chinese tourists, advertisements featuring Korean singers and actresses, product placements in Korean dramas and tag lines such as ""High-performance skincare powered by Asian Botanicals,"" Suh and his lieutenants have capitalized brilliantly on these developments. And what makes the storyline all the more appealing is that it's true to company's core values and heritage. AmorePacific traces its roots to the 1930s, when Suh's grandmother ""scattered the seeds of beauty"" by making camellia-based hair oils and creams as a sideline. His father, Sun Sung-Whan, took over the business in 1943 and ran it for more than five decades. The only one of six children to take an interest in the business, Suh, who grew up next door to the company's headquarters, joined Amore Pacific in the 1980s after earning an M.B.A. from Cornell University. Elevated to chief executive in 1997, he quickly expanded into overseas markets -- AmorePacific has a strong presence in U.S. department stores -- while investing heavily in dermatology research. Many of its products contain ingredients like  ginseng, soybean and green tea. Its luxury herbal cosmetic Sulhwasoo grew out of research into Oriental medicinal herbs. Its ""deep seawater"" cosmetic, Lirikos, is popular with Chinese consumers. In 2000, AmorePacific set up a breast cancer foundation. For more than a decade, it has supported the Korea's Pink Ribbon Love Marathon to help breast cancer victims. In 2010, Suh received an award from Ernst & Young naming him Korea's best CEO.

205,Billionaires,2015,3,maria-elisabeth-schaeffler-thumann,"The stereotype of financially conservative Germans having an aversion to leverage doesn't apply to Maria-Elisabeth Schaeffler-Thumann and her only son, Georg Schaeffler. They're proprietors of Schaeffler Group, which encompasses Schaeffler AG, one of the world's largest producers of ball bearings and machine components. In 2008, the company announced a $15-billion, debt-financed takeover of publicly traded tire and auto parts giant Continental AG. For a while, in the wake of the ensuing worldwide financial crisis, it looked as if the high-wire act might all come crashing down. Continental's sales and share price plummeted, forcing the Schaefflers into debt-restructuring negotiations with their creditor banks. When the dust settled, after a Continental rights offering to raise capital and a round of debt refinancing, the Schaefflers owned 49.9% of Continental. Since then, as the auto market has rebounded, they've continued to pay down debt via Continental share sales and excess cash flow. Since bottoming out in February 2009, Continental's share price has risen 18-fold. Through Schaeffler Group and its parent, Schaeffler Verwaltungs GmbH, Georg and Maria-Elisabeth now own 46% of Continental, a stake worth around $17 billion. Most of the increase in the Schaefflers' net worth is attributable to the continued spectacular success of Continental and a better understanding on the part of Forbes of the financial strength of Schaeffler Group, independent of Continental. The brothers Wilhelm and Georg Schaeffler (Maria-Elisabeth's husband), both holders of Ph.D. degrees, founded the manufacturer that became known as INA in Herzogenaurach, Germany, in 1946. Maria-Elisabeth took over the company in 1996 following the death of Georg (Wilhelm Schaeffler died in 1981). Her son (also named Georg), who practiced international business law in Dallas, returned home to help her run the business in 2009, amid the turbulences caused by the Continental AG takeover. In January 2013, a prestigious jury -- comprised of representatives from the German business world and the business newspaper Handelsblatt -- named Maria-Elisabeth Family Business Woman of the Year 2012. She owns 20% of umbrella company INA Holding Schaeffler GmbH & Co. KG and Georg, who is now the richest German, 80%. Today, Schaeffler Group, which had revenues of $15.4 billion in 2013, is active in the automotive, industrial and aerospace sectors, and employs 80,000 in about 170 locations in 49 countries.

Raised by his grandparents in a one-room flat with no running water, he apprenticed as a butcher and was expected to take over his family's butcher shop. Striking out on his own in 1974, Graf began importing American pinball machines to Austria via Belgium, then became an agent for a British slot machine company. When electronic machines came on the scene, he found a niche as a servicing specialist -- hiring qualified technicians and developing the expertise that led to the founding, in 1980, of Novomatic Automatenhandels AG, which introduced the Admiral line of gaming machines. Graf quickly extended his geographic reach, entering the Swiss market in 1982 and the East Bloc after the fall of the Iron Curtain. Operating casinos from Berlin to Santiago de Chile (many under the Admiral brand name), while also selling slots, video poker, video lottery, multiplayer games and electronic table games, Novomatic has thrived in a market hungry for innovation. Acquisitions have expanded its presence in online and mobile gaming, as well as the market for casino-management technology. Its modular ACP system allows operators to automate, monitor and control a wide range of functions -- from tracking wins and losses and player loyalty to analysis of gaming machine performance and the administration of jackpots. A new frontier for Novomatic is the development of biometric systems for initiating and authenticating the transfer of credits and controlling access to gaming premises and betting terminals. The $4.5 billion (2013 revenue) company has offices in more than 43 countries and exports gaming equipment to more than 80 countries.

Though never pressured to go into the family business, Cook remains dedicated to keeping the Cook Group privately-owned. In Hammel's book, the company heir remarked, ""I could take all this money and run, but that would leave everybody else in the company with the very strong possibility that they wouldn't have a job.""

Hans Liebherr recognized the need for machinery to rebuild his country while managing his parents' construction firm. With the introduction, in 1949, of the first mobile tower crane, which could be easily transported and erected, Hans Liebherr Maschinenfabrik (Engineering Works), was born, in Kirchdorf. After unveiling the first hydraulic excavator in Europe, in 1953, Hans branched out into the manufacture of appliances, aerospace components and systems, concrete mixers, machine tools, material-handling equipment, diesel engines and climate-control technology. All the while, his engineers kept finding new opportunities for deploying cranes with ever-increasing payloads: for ships, off-shore oil platforms, container ports and all-terrain trucks. When Hans died in 1993, at age 78, management control passed to Willi -- who joined the business in 1971, after earning a mechanical engineering degree from the Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich -- and his sister, Isolde, who joined the business in 1976 after earning a degree in management from the Business School of Mannheim (Germany).  Subsequently, their children assumed management positions within the company. Willi's son Jan shares management responsibility with his father for separate divisions focused on earthmoving machinery and components (diesel and gas engines, fuel-injection systems, hydraulic cylinders, gearboxes, winches, etc.), while sister Sophie Albrecht likewise shares management responsibility with Willi for the mobile cranes and mining divisions (the latter includes equipment such as hydraulic excavators weighing up to 880 tons). Isolde's daughter Stéfanie Wohlfarth shares management duties with her mother for the appliances division. Sister Patricia Ruef presides over the maritime cranes division with her mother, while also sharing responsibility with Willi for the machine tools and automation systems division.

The Brooklyn native built his Renco Group into one of the nation's largest holding companies. In 2011 he bought steel assets from Russia's OAO Severstal through a new company, RG Steel. Fourteen months later RG filed for bankruptcy and laid off 4,000 workers. In January 2013 RG's creditors sued, accusing Rennert of delaying bankruptcy proceedings for personal gain, but the creditors withdrew the suit the next month. In 1992 Rennert paid $133 million for military contractor AM General, which started selling consumer Hummers. In 2004 he sold a majority stake to billionaire Ronald Perelman's MacAndrews & Forbes for $930 million. Renco's holdings include the Doe Run Company, a mining outfit in Peru that is the subject of a long-running pollution suit.

244,Billionaires,2015,3,hansjoerg-wyss,"Hansjoerg Wyss is among the most philanthropic people in the world, with charitable foundations that have assets of nearly $2 billion. Wyss' fortue stems from his 2012 sale of medical device manufacturer Synthes -- which he founded --  to Johnson & Johnson for $20.2 billion in cash and stock. He's been ramping up his giving since the Synthes sale. In 2014, he pledged $120 million to two Swiss universities, University of Zurich and ETH Zurich, to establish a center to accelerate medical breakthroughs. In 2013, he pledged $125 million to Harvard University -- on top of the $125 million he contributed to the university in 2009 to establish a biological institute bearing his name to research how nature builds, controls and makes things. The longtime Wyoming resident and noted conservationist also donated $4.25 million in 2013 to The Trust for Public Land, a U.S. nonprofit group, to purchase oil and gas leases on 58,000 acres of land in Wyoming's Hoback Basin to protect it from development. In 2014, a U.S. Senate investigation into offshore tax evasion -- which did not implicate Wyss -- revealed emails from Wyss' private bankers at Credit Suisse bickering over custody of his Synthes' sale proceeds.

258,Billionaires,2015,3,chung-mong-koo,"Chung Mong-Koo is chairman of Hyundai Motor Co., the world's fifth largest automaker having sold (along with its Kia affiliate) around 8 million vehicles in 2014. He is the second son of the late Chung Ju-Yung, the eldest son of a peasant farming family who, after the Korean War, repaired trucks for the U.S. Army and went on to assemble a conglomerate that, as much as any, set Korea on the path to becoming an export powerhouse and Asia's fourth-largest economy. Most of his six sons, at his discretion, wound up presiding over various fiefdoms within the sprawling group. Chung Mong-Koo took the reins of Hyundai Motor, while his younger brother Chung Mong-Joon, also a billionaire, wound up running Korea's leading shipbuilder, Hyundai Heavy Industries. Chung Mong-Koo's billionaire son and presumed successor, Chung Eui-Sun, is vice chairman of Hyundai Motor. In 2007, Chung Mong-Koo was sentenced to three years in prison for embezzling corporate funds. He was released after serving a few months when an appeals court judge suspended the sentence, noting Chung's importance to the Korean economy. To make amends, Chung agreed to donate $1 billion over several years to benefit Korean society. Turning 77 on March 19, 2015, the hard-charging chairman, who is known for his obsession with quality and has driven a rapid expansion of production into new markets such as China and Brazil, shows no sign of retiring. Having come a long way in upgrading the company's image as a maker of inexpensive, no-frills cars, he faces a challenging environment trying to compete with Japanese rivals like Toyota Motor Corp., as the Korea's currency has strengthened relative to Japan's, making Hyundai's exports more expensive. He predicted the group's 2015 sales would increase by just 2.5% -- the weakest rate in more than a decade. Meanwhile, in Korea, the monopolistic position of Hyundai Motor Co. and Kia Motors has eroded considerably, as imported cars have increased their presence at a rapid rate in the wake of a 2011 free-trade deal eliminating duties on vehicles from Europe. Chung's stake in Hyundai Motor is worth about $1.6 billion.

After selling clothes for more than a decade, he opened the first Massa department store in 1965. He sold the chain in 1985, but smartly held on to the underlying property. Under a 30-year lease deal with retailer Metro, he collects Eu 52.66 million ($60 million) a year in rent. Kipp has divested most if not all of his commercial real estate holdings in the U.S., notably 950 Third Avenue and other high-end office properties in Manhattan. These days, he tends to his Swiss luxury hotel and resort group, which he regards as more of a hobby than a source of investment returns.

He has three five-star properties: the Tschuggen Grand Hotel in Arosa, where he lives with his wife, Hannelore; the all-suite Carlton Hotel in St. Moritz; and the Hotel Eden Roc in Ascona, named hotel of the year last August by the prestigious Gault&Millau ratings guide. His Hotel Valsana in Arosa is a four-star property. Back in May 2002, Kipp gave his first interview in 15 years to the Swiss magazine Bilanz. When asked what he thought of Forbes's calculation of his wealth, he replied: ""That's a worth question, anyone can come around and count for a couple of weeks.

The downward spiral had come about unexpectedly, after secretive Adolf -- once one of Germany's wealthiest men -- took a hit in the 2008 financial crisis. He'd taken out a loan to recapitalize HeidelbergCement, and used shares he owned in the company as collateral. After Heidelberg stock lost 75% of its value and the banks demanded early repayment of the loan and additional collateral, Adolf committed suicide. Ludwig has restructured the group and executed an impressive turnaround. In the fall of 2009, he unloaded shares of HeidelbergCement, cutting his stake from 74% to 25%. The following year, he sold generic drug maker Ratiopharm to Teva Pharmaceuticals for $5 billion. It looked as if Phoenix Group might have to go on the block as well, given the extent of the liabilities Adolf had assumed in assembling the drug wholesaler through acquisitions, but the company was saved when banks came through with a syndicated loan facility. Now $28 billion (2013 sales) Phoenix, which also operates more than 1,580 retail pharmacies in 12 countries (many under the brand name BENU), is deleveraging even as it's being buffeted by challenging economic conditions in Europe.

Merckle Group is seeking damages of Eu 231 million ($263 million), alleging that Porsche wrongfully manipulated the share price of Volkswagen in 2008 and thereby caused a ""short squeeze,"" torpedoing a bet by Adolf Merckle that shares of the automaker would fall.

The company never gained a foothold in the United States, having lost a court dispute there in the mid-1990s, in which a wind turbine maker, now defunct, accused Enercon of infringing on its patents. It also has encountered trouble in India, where a subsidiary carried out a kind of coup d'état and unilaterally wrested control from its German parent. And although Enercon has no plans to enter China, prospects are favorable enough in Canada, Europe, Brazil and other South American countries for it to continue on its slow-but-steady growth trajectory. Meanwhile, it has diversified into rail transport, establishing four hubs in Germany and routes into Italy and Portugal. A man of strong opinions, Wobben spoke out against the Iraq war and doesn't lament his company's lack of presence in the U.S. market.

Ecclestone built the sport from a niche competition to a global phenomenon after buying the Brabham Racing team in 1971 and making it a powerhouse with Nelson Piquet and Niki Lauda behind the wheel. Along with his trusted deputy, Max Mosley, they waged war against F1's governing body, eventually taking it over as Ecclestone realized the future was in television. Ecclestone managed to group broadcasting rights by promising teams a profit, effectively controlling the sport's major revenue stream which he grew to gigantic proportions. While jetting from race to race, Ecclestone met former model Slavica, who became his wife for 24 years before getting divorced in 2009; their daughters Petra and Tamara have become famous socialites and reality TV stars. Recently, Ecclestone was mired in legal troubles, accused of bribing German banker Gerhard Gribkowsky in the heat of the 2006 sale of the F1 group of companies to CVC Capital Partners.

As president of Kia, from 2005 to 2009, he successfully made over the company's brand image -- hiring renowned automotive designer Peter Schreyer to phase out the bland, boxy styling that had made Kia models like the Soul objects of derision among auto buffs. During his tenure at the helm, Kia grew faster than its Hyundai Motor affiliate -- allowing Chung to begin to step outside the shadow cast by his formidable father, who is known for his obsession with quality and hard-charging management style. In 2009, Chung became vice chairman of Hyundai Motor. He was appointed to the company's board in 2010, bringing him a step closer to becoming the third generation of his family to lead Hyundai. While his billionaire father derives most of his wealth from his stake in Hyundai Motor, the wellspring of most of Chung's fortune is Hyundai Glovis Co., which functions as a holding company for stakes in Hyundai affiliates while also providing logistics services to those affiliates and other clients.

In September 2013, the Seoul High Court rejected Chey's appeal of the conviction and also overturned the acquittal of his younger brother, former SK Vice Chairman Chey Jae-Won, sentencing him to three years and six months for conspiring with the elder Chey, who, in 2003, spent seven months in prison for accounting fraud. He returned to SK after his release, and was pardoned in 2008. Chey's downfall seems to belie his pedigree. Married to a daughter of Korea's former president, Roh Tae Woo, he has a B.A. in Physics from Korea University and a Ph.D. in Economics from the University of Chicago; taught at elite Seoul National University; and was a regular attendee at the World Economic Forum in Davos. Under his leadership, SK Group's flagship, SK Telecom, became the country's dominant mobile carrier. In 2012, it became a major player in the memory chip market via a merger with Hynix (formerly Hyundai Electronics). Another key affiliate, SK Energy, is Korea's biggest refiner. But most of Chey's wealth is derived from a 33% stake in SK C&C, which owns pieces of various SK affiliates and provides consulting and IT services to them and other clients. The company received a big vote of confidence last year when contract manufacturing giant Hon Hai Precision, the major supplier of iPhones and iPads, purchased a 4.9% stake for around $377 million. The seller of the shares was Chey, whose net worth has grown by $1 billion over the last year thanks mostly to a 76% rise in the share price of SK C&C.

501,Billionaires,2015,3,ingvar-kamprad,"Ingvar Kamprad, founder of global furniture retailer IKEA, died on January 27, 2018 at age 91. Kamprad created IKEA when he was 17, peddling matches, fish and Christmas cards by bicycle. He opened his first furniture store in 1947 and built it into one of the world's most successful retailers, with fiscal 2017 revenues of nearly $46 billion. Kamprad relentlessly pursued efficiency to keep his furniture prices low and showed little interest in the trappings of wealth, at one point driving a Volvo for two decades. Between 2005 and 2010, Kamprad was estimated by Forbes to be one of the 10 richest people in the world, worth as much as $28 billion, based largely on the value of IKEA.

In 1992 he established the company Nafta Moskva which were specialized on different kinds of investments. Back in 2008 he sold nearly all his Russian assets, including shares in Gazprom, government-owned Sberbank and a massive housing development in suburban Moscow just before Russia's financial meltdown. He borrowed heavily to buy stakes in Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, Deutsche Bank, Credit Suisse and others. He lost billions soon after. But he recovered and, with the help of loans from Russia's VTB bank, began investing again in the Russian market, buying a stake in the nation's largest gold mining outfit, Polyus Gold, in PIK Group and in leading long-distance telephony provider Rostelecom (he sold his Rostelecom stake in 2012). In the summer of 2010 he bought billionaire Dmitry Rybolovlev's stake in Uralkali. In exchange he gave Rybolovlev a portion of his stake in Polyus Gold. In 2013 Suleiman Kerimov got caught up in the so-called ""potash war"" between Belarus and Uralkali, Russia's biggest producer of potassium fertilizers, where Kerimov was the largest shareholder. The dispute drove down the value of all Russian fertilizer companies. In August 2013 Belarusian authorities arrested Uralkali's CEO, saying he abused his power and embezzled funds while his company was involved in a trading alliance with Belaruskali, a fertilizer company owned by the Belarusian government. Together the companies controlled 40% of the global market for the fertilizer additive. The Belarusian government said Uralkali and Belaruskali could resume their relationship if Kerimov sold his stake. Billionaire Mikhail Prokhorov together with billionaire Dmitry Mazepin, an owner of mineral fertilizer company Uralchem, agreed to buy it. That put to rest talk by Belarus that it intended to arrest Kerimov, who also wound up selling his stake in Russia's largest real estate and homebuilding company, PIK Group, and slashing funding to his soccer team, Anji Makhachkala, selling off its star players. By early 2015 he sold substantially all of its assets except the share in Polyus Gold. But his son bought from billionaire Vladimir Potanin cinema chain Cinema Park for $300 mil.

Five years later, having passed through Padua's Istituto Marconi to study textile manufacturing because he thought it was easy, he joined denim guru Adriano Goldschmied at Moltex, an Italian manufacturing outfit. In 1978, they renamed the firm Diesel in a nod to the decade's oil crises, and by '85 Rosso had bought Diesel outright from Goldschmied to focus on the American market. Betting on rising incomes among style-conscious, rich youngsters of the Wall Street boom era, and relying on ad campaigns that were controversial for controversy's sake, Diesel took the U.S. market by surprise, experiencing hockey stick growth selling expensive jeans. Rosso added high-end manufacturer Staff International to his portfolio in order to streamline operations, bringing design, production, and distribution in-house in 2000, while in 2002 he began an acquisition spree that included up-market fashion houses like Paris's Maison Margiela, Amsterdam's Viktor & Rolf in 2008, and Milanese name Marni in 2012.

Tengelmann generated approximately 97% of its $10.8 billion in 2013 revenue from retail operations. Divisions include Kaiser's and Tengelmann supermarkets; OBI DIY (home improvement) stores; clothing and non-food discounter KiK; and dollar-store chain TEDi. Tengelmann announced its intention last year to sell Kaiser's to competitor Edeka; the deal is under review by antitrust regulators. Karl-Erivan's brother Georg Haub oversees TREI Real Estate, which manages around 500 properties in Germany and six other European countries, while brother Christian W. E. Haub serves as co-CEO of Tengelmann and chairman of Greenwich, Connecticut-based Emil Capital Partners, an umbrella for all Tengelmann investment activities in North America. Another unit, Tengelmann E-Commerce, comprises various Tengelmann online retailing ventures as well as stakes in an array of digital businesses including Zalanao (the European equivalent of online shoe and clothing retailer Zappo's). There's also an energy services provider, Tengelmann Energie GmbH (TEG), which supplies commercial customers with electricity and gas, and a professional services outfit specializing in audits and consulting. Erivan Haub has strong ties to the United States -- in particular, Tacoma, Washington, where his sons were born.

In 1985, Murdock bought the failing Hawaiian real estate outfit that owned Dole and 98% of the Hawaiian island Lanai. He took Dole public in 2009, the same year he got an honorary high school diploma. Murdock sold his portion of Lanai to billionaire Larry Ellison for a reported $300 million in 2012 and likely used the cash to finance the Dole buy-out.

He develops properties for younger moguls, a plan that relies less on debt. Plus, he has recently started developing more affordable rental units. Born in Argentina to Cuban parents, Perez started out as an urban planner and then moved into developing low-income housing. A chance meeting with New York developer Stephen Ross led to a partnership (and both are billionaires today). The two cofounded Related Group of Florida, an affiliate of Ross' Related Companies, in 1979. They built affordable housing in the 1980s, then switched to high-end condo construction. Perez himself has developed 80,000 properties in South Florida over time. Related Group condos are known for the high-end art placed inside the buildings' public spaces, and the corporate collection totals some 1,000 pieces. Perez should understand what pleases the eye. He's an avid art collector himself. In 2011 he pledged $35 million in cash and artwork over ten years to the Miami Art Museum, which then agreed to rename it the Jorge M.

623,Billionaires,2015,3,hans-peter-wild,"Hans Peter Wild is saying goodbye to his flavors business. Last July, one of the world's largest agricultural processors, Illinois-based Archer-Daniels Midland Co. (ADM), announced that it was buying WILD Flavors for around $3 billion in cash. About two-thirds of that amount is to be paid to Wild, whose father started the business in 1931, with the remaining $1 billion going to funds affiliated with the investor group Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. (KKR), which acquired a 35% stake in the business in 2010. With over $1.2 billion in annual revenue, WILD Flavors provides food and beverage companies with fruit juice concentrates and blends as well flavors and extracts, colors from natural sources, sweetening systems, seasonings and fermentation technologies. Wild, 73, didn't have a successor, so he decided to entertain offers for the company. He still owns Arios Holding; based in Zug, Switzerland, its assets include INDAG, which develops and manages modern processing units as well as machines for the food and beverage industries; and the world-famous fruit juice brand Capri Sun. Before joining Rudolf Wild GmbH in 1974, Hans Peter Wild studied business administration and law (he earned a doctorate from the Faculty of Law at the University of Mannheim for his dissertation ""Dealing with monopolistic companies under French Law""). As a student, he made several trips abroad in search of innovative alternative sources of raw materials for the family business. After graduation, he gained managerial experience working for a marketer of mineral oil and chemicals. His biggest coup was signing Muhammed Ali, then at the peak of his boxing career, as an advertising spokesman. ""I am the greatest. The whole world knows it. But the day I stop boxing, Capri Sun will be greatest,"" proclaimed Ali.

624,Billionaires,2015,3,oprah-winfrey,"Fresh off her role in hit film ""Lee Daniels' The Butler"", Winfrey spent much of 2014 promoting award-winning Martin Luther King, Jr. biopic ""Selma"". Her movie imprint Harpo Films co-produced the critical darling; she also had a small role as civil rights activist Annie Lee Cooper. In the fall, she hit the road with her 'The Life You Want' tour, selling out stadiums from Newark to Seattle with her inimitable brand of self-help starting at $99 for a nosebleed seat. The one-time queen of daytime TV appears to have disproved naysayers with the success of her cable network OWN. The once-struggling channel, now cash-flow positive, has seen its ratings soar thanks in part to a handful of sitcom and drama collaborations with director Tyler Perry. Winfrey still earns millions annually from the successful spin-off stars she helped create, including Dr. Phil, Rachael Ray and Dr. Oz.

The following year they formed a partnership with the Haniel family and the late billionaire Otto Beisheim to propagate Metro Cash & Carry -- a chain of self-service wholesale markets. Metro AG went public in 1996, after the merger of Metro Cash & Carry with multi-channel retailers Kaufhof Holding AG and Asko Deutsche Kaufhaus AG.

Metro Group generates annual revenues in excess of $70 billion and employs approximately 225,000 people in about 30 countries.

Kyobo is Korea's third-largest life insurer in terms of premium income, with an 11% market share in 2013, according to Fitch Ratings. Through an extensive distribution network of agents and financial planners, the company offers insurance and asset-management products to more than five million customers. Besides traditional life insurance -- a mature and highly competitive market in Korea -- the company offers health, disability and long-term care coverage. Retirement planning and financial consulting services; annuities and mutual funds; and pension products for individuals and businesses also figure into the mix. The company consistently receives high marks in third-party assessments of costumer satisfaction, corporate ethics, social responsibility and community service. Shin, who maintains a busy schedule of public speeches and lectures, is known for his engaging personality and commitment to helping others. ""When it comes to encouraging his employees,"" the company notes on its website, ""Mr. Shin never gets tired of transforming himself into stunning figures: an aproned waiter, a chef in uniform, and a singer playing guitar at charity meetings organized by his employees."" In 2010, he received the 19th Montblanc de la Culture Arts Patronage Award for his long-time support of Korean literature through the Daesan Foundation, established under the auspices of Kyobo Life Insurance by his father. Shin Chang-Jae has served as chairman of the foundation since 1993.

Under his leadership, Brose evolved from being a national manufacturer into a world market leader in electrical and mechanical components and integrated systems that are largely invisible to vehicle drivers. ""No matter where in the world a car door is opened, a window regulator operated, a car seat adjusted or the air conditioning turned on -- you will almost always find our technology in use,"" according to the company's website. ""At least every third vehicle on the road today is equipped with one or more Brose products."" Approximately 23,000 employees work for the company at 58 locations in 23 countries. Annual revenues top $5.8 billion. At the end of 2005, Stoschek withdrew from operational management and became chairman of Brose Group. He has received a host of honors: the Initiative Prize of the Stiftung Industrieforschung (Industrial Research Foundation); the Merit Cross 1st class from the Federal Republic of Germany's Order of Merit; and the Family Entrepreneur of the Year award.

In 2013 the partners, together with Arkady Rotenberg, a billionaire who practices judo with Vladimir Putin, won a tender to develop part of Sheremetyevo, the state-owned airport outside Moscow. The project includes a new terminal for 15 million passengers, a building that will hold 500,000 tons of cargo, a refueling complex and a tunnel connecting the airport's southern and northern complexes. The partners have already invested $1 billion in the project. A unit of the partners' TPS Real Estate Holdings Ltd. is the main contender to buy the government's 83% stake in the airport in a privatization plan slated for 2016. In the summer of 2012 Ponomarenko and Skorobogatko joined with Rotenberg to found TPS. The company bought more than half of the space in Ocean Plaza, the biggest shopping center in Kiev, for $280 million. In January 2011 Skorobogatko and Ponomarenko made $1 billion when they sold a stake in Novorossiysk Commercial Sea Port, Russia's biggest, to state-owned Transneft and its affiliate Summa Capital. Ponomoarenko and Skorobogatko established a small perfume factory in Ukraine and then founded Russian General Bank in Moscow, which served the Novorossiysk port operation.

Now a diversified conglomerate, it operates the country's largest food and beverage company, CJ Cheiljedang, famous for convenience items such as microwaveable rice. CJ Foodville runs Western-style family restaurants as well as bakeries, cafes and ice cream shops under various brand names.

With financial support from his sister, a seamstress, he completed his studies and went on to work in the financial industry, first selling insurance policies. As his career progressed, his ambition grew, and he felt the entrepreneurial itch. Hearing Silvio Berlusconi, one of the country's most prominent businessmen, publicly say, ""if anyone has an idea and needs an investor, come find me; if it's a good idea, we'll make it happen together,"" he decided to seek him out. After meeting in the city of Portofino, Doris pitched Berlusconi on his idea: a financial services company that offered a wide variety of products. In 1982, they founded Programma Italia, which promoted the use of financing and credit. Restructured in 1996 into Mediolanum, which they took public that year, the firm, with Doris as CEO, offers life insurance, fund management, real estate loans, and other products. Doris is the public face of the company's advertising campaigns.

With young mines and low costs, Foresight should survive and thrive as other mines shut down. After taking units in Foresight Energy LP public in 2014, the value of his holdings is $1.8 billion. Cline grew up in West Virginia. As a youngster, his father would pay him a penny a bag to excavate dirt from under the front porch. When the porch collapsed he learned a valuable lesson about the importance of engineering that he later applied to the roofs of mines. In the 1990s, Cline had the foresight to buy up coal reserves in the Illinois Basin, acquiring mines from the likes of U.S. Steel and Exxon. No one had wanted the coal after 1992 amendments to the Clean Air Act because it was high in sulfur content, and created lots of sulfur dioxide when burned for electricity. But Cline believed that innovations and pollution control technology would allow coal to make a comeback. Because the high-sulfur coal had been ignored for so long, the coal seams are thicker, not as deep underground, and thus easier (and cheaper) to mine. As a result his costs, at roughly $22 per ton, are significantly lower than the $50 per ton incurred at the average mine east of the Mississippi.",1006,billionaires,1900.0,Energy,0,350.0,"{'name': 'Christopher Cline', 'uri': 'christopher-cline', 'imageExists': True, 'squareImage': '//specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/59de7c1f31358e542c039f26/416x416.jpg?background=000000&cropX1=621&cropX2=1842&cropY1=330&cropY2=1551'}",True,Christopher Cline,56.0,United States,Florida,North Palm Beach,coal,['Energy'],United States,,1491252037727,19,0.0,0.0,0.0,faris/5/2015/13540,1014,True,500.0,35.71428571428572,True,U,M,-362692800000.0,225.0,Cline,Christopher,The World's Billionaires,,,http://onforb.es/1IR6Yer,,http://onforb.es/1IR71XC,1425272400000,False,False,10.0,1210.0,http://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/59de7c1f31358e542c039f26/280x425.jpg?fit=scale&background=000000,South,//specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/59de7c1f31358e542c039f26/416x416.jpg?background=000000&cropX1=621&cropX2=1842&cropY1=330&cropY2=1551,False,"['rank', 'finalWorth', 'personName', 'bios', 'bio']",False,"Miami-Fort Lauderdale-Pompano Beach, FL",,,,,,,,,

He turned his attention from notes to nudes--becoming Penthouse's U.K. licensee, later expanding to titles such as Asian Babes and Posh Housewives. After selling some of his portfolio, he invested $50 million into celebrity magazine OK!. While adult content remains a part of his holdings today, a bigger chunk of his fortune are in mass-market publications like The Daily Express and Daily Star.

More are in the pipeline, he says. He built his Texas practice on personal injury cases but is best known for representing Pennzoil against Texaco in the oil giants' high-profile legal battle in 1987. He won $10.5 billion for Pennzoil and personally pocketed $345 million in contingency fees. In 2012 the Tarlton Law Library at the University of Texas acquired the case's transcripts for students to study it. With his late wife Lee, he established the Lee and Joseph D.

The son of a Nebraska carpenter, Ricketts got his first job working as a janitor's assistant when he was in the third grade.

The seeds of Ameritrade date back to 1975, when Ricketts co-founded a Nebraska-based discount stock brokerage, which he named Ameritrade in 1983. He merged with a small online trading firm in 1995, and the soon-to-be Internet heavyweight went public two years later. Adding to its heft, Ricketts acquired TD Waterhouse for $2.9 billion in 2006. He renamed the company TD Ameritrade. The company averages 400,000 trades placed by customers each day, helping it generate a record $3.1 billion in revenue in 2014. Ricketts stepped down as chairman in 2008, but he and his family remain large shareholders; Joe owns a 9% stake. His son, Peter, was elected governor of Nebraska in 2014. The Ricketts family bought the Chicago Cubs, Wrigley Field and a stake in a local sports network for $845 million in 2009, and Ricketts' children (Tom, Todd, Peter and Laura) run it. In 2005, Ricketts founded Opportunity Education Foundation to increase access to quality education for children in developing nations, providing school materials for some 500,000 students in 11 countries in Africa, the Middle East and Asia.

Gertler's grandfather was the first president of the Israeli Diamond Exchange; Gertler sold off those diamond assets to fund his other purchases in copper, gold and oil mining. He bought his first mine in the tumultuous DRC in 1997 and soon became friends with Joseph Kabila, who then ran the military and has been president since his father, Laurent Kabila, was assassinated in 2001. Fleurette claims to be one of the country's largest taxpayers and employers, with 30,000 Congolese employed directly or indirectly by the companies in which it has a stake. Gertler had a busy 2014, announcing a joint-venture to build new infrastructure projects in the DRC with a Brazilian construction company and continued exploration of an oil formation in Lake Albert, where early seismic tests have revealed as many as 3 billion barrels of oil -- though the viability of extraction is unclear.

1205,Billionaires,2015,3,wolfgang-leitner,"When Wolfgang Leitner arrived at ANDRITZ Group in 1983, as a management consultant for McKinsey & Company, the supplier of industrial systems and heavy equipment was reeling. Mired in losses caused by the second global oil crisis and worldwide economic stagnation, the company, where Leitner's father had worked as a machine fitter for 30 years, survived thanks to Austrian government subsidies and drastic rationalization measures. (A native of ANDRITZ's hometown of Graz, Austria, Leitner had begun his career as a research chemist and would go on to found a pharmaceutical company, GENERICON Pharma GmbH, before joining McKinsey.) By 1987, he was ANDRITZ's CFO; at that time, the company had sales of around Eu 194 million and profits of just under Eu 1 million. In 1994, he was appointed president and CEO. Five years later, backed by private-equity investors including Carlyle Group and GE Capital, he led a management buyout of the company. In 2001, ANDRITZ went public on the Vienna Stock Exchange. Since 1990, it has acquired more than 60 companies, building its market presence as a provider of high-tech production systems. Its primary segments are hydropower stations, machinery for the pulp and paper industry as well as the metalforming and steel industry, plus solid/liquid separation equipment (centrifuges, filtering systems, etc.) for the municipal and industrial sectors. It is also a leading supplier of systems and services for the feed industry (aquatic, livestock and pet food). Through the first nine months of 2014, ANDRITZ recorded net income of around Eu 122 million ($138 million) on sales of Eu 4.12 billion ($4.65 billion).

Perez Companc's biggest move was to sell his energy company, Pecom, to Brazil's Petrobras for approximately $1.2 billion in 2001. He started out working in the family banking group, Banco Rio and bought his family in the early 1990s. In 1997, he sold it to Spanish banking giant Santander. During the 1990s, a wave of privatization enabled Perez Companc to buy stakes in all sorts of Argentine businesses, from telecommunications and public utilities to railroads and shopping malls. In 1990 he invested $400 million for a 60% stake in Molinos Rio de La Plata, a diversified maker of pasta, flour, and frozen vegetables, which he has built into one of the major food producers and exporters of Argentina; in 2009, he transferred his 75% stake to his 7 living children. He also owns Goyaike, which has more than 740,000 acres throughout Argentina used for wool production, crops, cattle, and milk production.

1244,Billionaires,2015,3,shin-dong-bin,"Shin Dong-Bin derives his fortune from the sprawling Lotte Group, which is comprised of two networks of affiliates, in Korea and Japan. Its business activities run the gamut from food, beverages and retail to chemicals and construction; from pharmaceuticals and IT services to golf courses, hotel management and professional baseball. The group's biggest project ever -- the culmination of Shin Dong-Bin's expansive ambitions -- is ""a global city of the future"" under construction in Seoul's Songpa neighborhood. Equivalent in size to 110 soccer fields, its most prominent feature will be the 123-floor, 555-meter Lotte World Tower, which will boast the world's highest observation deck, offering visitors an experience akin to ""walking in the clouds."" The sleek tower also will include a luxurious, ""Six star"" Lotte Hotel and the world's highest art gallery (on floors 117 through 119), as well as residential and office space. The project's 11-story commercial building -- incorporating the Lotte World Mall with approximately 1,000 businesses including such staples of the Lotte empire as Lotte Cinema, Lotte Mart, Lotte Duty Free and consumer electronics retailer Hi Mart -- opened in October 2014. Other features of the complex, which is slated for completion in 2016: a medical center, spa, aquarium and concert hall (with a 5,000-pipe organ), as well as broad green space with an outdoor lake. Shin is the youngest son of Shin Kyeok-Ho, who founded Lotte as a confectionary manufacturer. He studied economics at Aoyama Gakuin University and has an M.B.A. from Columbia University. Since taking over as chairman of Lotte's Korean affiliates in 2011, he has been aggressively expanding abroad -- opening department stores, cinemas, supermarkets and hypermarkets in Indonesia, China and Viet Nam. The group's discount retail chain, Lotte Mart, has over 200 locations. Fast-food chain Lotteria also is becoming a fixture in Southeast Asian markets. The group's Korea Seven company operates 7-Eleven convenience stores. Most of the companies that comprise the conglomerate are private. Shin's 13.5% stake in the group's most important listed company -- Lotte Shopping, which began with a single department store in 1979 -- accounts for around $910 million of his fortune. In early 2015, Shin's older brother, Shin Dong-Joo, was fired from executive positions within the group. He had been overseeing Lotte's Japanese affiliates (which generate roughly $5 billion in revenue versus more than $75 billion for the Korean affiliates). The decision seems to portend that Shin Dong-Bin will succeed his elderly father as general chairman of Lotte Group.

In 1992, following the death of his father, Gerling, an economist by training, sold a 30% stake to Deutsche Bank. He chaired the supervisory board but showed little interest in managing the business. Eventually, mismanagement coupled with losses from the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks and costly asbestos claims plunged his legacy into turmoil. Forced to sell assets to raise capital, Gerling Konzern became a shadow of its former self, with premium income dropping from around $9.2 billion in 2001 to $5.4 billion in 2003. Deutsche Bank, after having raised is stake to 34.5% through capital injections, bailed out in 2003, basically receiving in exchange for its interest a share of the credit insurer Gerling NCM, which had been hived off in a deal involving another Gerling Konzern shareholder, Swiss Re. Finally, in 2005, Gerling sold his 94% stake in Gerling Konzern to Talanx Group, Germany's third largest insurance company, for an estimated $1.6 billion. Gerling, a passionate environmentalist who lives in Switzerland, helped establish the now-closed Gerling Academy for Risk Research, a think tank set up to study the industrial world's impact on the environment. While overseeing Gerling Konzern, he raised awareness of environmental-related risk factors within the insurance industry. In the 90s, he was instrumental in getting 50 insurance companies to sign a United Nations pledge to consider the issues of climate change and other environmental problems in their business practices.

1300,Billionaires,2015,3,evan-spiegel,"Evan Spiegel is the CEO of Snapchat, the temporary photo messaging company he cofounded with Bobby Murphy in 2011. After growing up comfortably in the Los Angeles area, he studied product design at Stanford and met Murphy, who was two years ahead of him and studying math, at the Kappa Sigma frat house. The two eventually developed an app that could send photo messages to contacts with a timer that would remove them in 10 seconds or less and called it Picaboo. It flopped. Rebranded as Snapchat, the app took off in the fall of 2011 and is now used by 100 million people monthly, for free. In late 2013 Spiegel turned down a $3 billion buyout offer from Facebook. In February 2015 the company reportedly received offers that would value it at $19 billion. Forbes estimates that Speigel and Murphy each have ownership stakes of at least 15%. In September 2014 the duo got rid of a significant distraction, settling out of court with another former fraternity brother and early creator of the app, Reggie Brown. Spiegel sees a big future for his company. ""There are very few people in the world who get to build a business like this,"" he told Forbes in late 2013.

The group, which began in 1955 with the Donghwa Deptartment Store, has diversified interests in retailing, hospitality, fashion, IT services, construction and food and beverage. Shinsegae International was spun off in 1996 and has been growing rapidly. It imports and distributes approximately 30 premium brands, including Armani, Dolce & Gabbana, Givenchy and Celine, to approximately 260 stores throughout Korea. It also manufactures and distributes its own fashion brands (VOV, G-Cut and Tomboy) and markets household and consumer goods under the brand name Jaju as well as the Vidi Vici line of cosmetics. In May 2011, Shinsegae, while holding onto its chain of department stores, spun off E-Mart Co. Ltd., now the country's biggest discount store chain with approximately 150 Emart locations including 15 in China. The multi-channel retailer, founded in 1993, also consists of grocery stores (Emart Everyday), e-commerce (Emart Mall) and a series of specialty retailers: Molly's Pet Shop, Matrix (electronics), Sports Big Ten, Boons (health and beauty) and Payless (shoes). Shinsegae formed a joint venture with Starbucks in 1999 and now operates more than 500 licensed locations. Success in retail, meanwhile, has helped boost other Shinsegae Group affiliates. So, for example, Shinsegae I&C, spun out as an independent company in 1997, provides IT services and maintains technology infrastructure for Shinsegae retail operations. Likewise, Shinsegae Engineering & Construction, founded in 1991, builds department stores, hypermarkets and themed shopping malls for the group.

After World War II, his grandson Rudolf August Oetker, a former Nazi SS officer, quickly rose to prominence as the driving force behind one of Germany's most recognizable brands. In 1950, according to the family history ""Die Oetkers,"" Oetker produced more than 750 million packages of baking and pudding powder. Personifying Germany's Wirtschaftswunder, or economic miracle, he developed additional food products and expanded into beverages, container shipping, financial services and luxury hotels (properties include the Brenners Park-Hotel & Spa in Baden-Baden, Germany; Hotel du Cap-Eden-Roc in Cap d'Antibes, on the French Riviera; and Hotel Le Bristol in Paris). Chairman of the company's advisory board when he died in 2007, at age 90, he left behind eight children from three marriages. Today, each of his heirs and their families own 12.5% percent of Bielefeld-based Dr. August Oetker KG. The equitable distribution of shares, however, has not proven to be a recipe for harmony, as the siblings have disagreed over the management and future direction of Oetker.

Rosely Schweizer studied economics in Innsbruck, Austria, worked at the family's sparkling wine and spirits company Henkell & Soehnlein, and served as the conglomerate's advisory board chairwoman until 2010.

1608,Billionaires,2015,3,cho-yang-rai,"Cho Yang-Rai is Chairman of Hankook Tire Worldwide, a holding company whose affiliate, Hankook Tire Co., is the world's seventh-largest tire manufacturer. The business was founded by Cho's father, Hyosung Group Founder Cho Hong-Je, in 1941. Separated from Hyosung Group in 1985, it now exports to 180 countries and employs about 21,000 people. With seven production facilities in Korea, China, Indonesia and Hungary, Hankook has a combined production capacity of 94 million tires and generates annual revenue of around $6 billion. The company plans to begin operations at an $800-million factory in Tennessee by the end of 2016. It's also diversifying its business portfolio. In December 2014, Visteon Corp. agreed to sell its South Korean unit, which makes heating and cooling systems for vehicles, for $3.6 billion. Hankook is paying around $985 million for 19.49% of the business; the rest will be owned by Hahn & Co, a Seoul-based private equity firm. Cho announced his retirement in 1988 to run the Hankook Tire Foundation, but he returned as chairman in 2012 when the holding company structure went into effect. His eldest son, Cho Hyun-Shick, is president and CEO of Hankook Tire Worldwide. Brother Cho Hyun-Bum, son-in-law of former South Korea president Lee Myung-Bak, is president and chief marketing officer/chief corporate management officer of Hankook Tire Co. While Hankook has certainly gained the respect of better-known competitors, suspicions about worker safety have caused friction with its labor union.

Most of his six sons, at his discretion, wound up presiding over various fiefdoms within the sprawling group. The youngest son, Mong-Joon, wound up running one of the biggest prizes, shipbuilder Hyundai Heavy Industries (HHI). It was a reward for his intellectual accomplishment. He was the only family member to attend prestigious Seoul National University, majoring in economics, and he went on to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Sloan School of Management for his M.B.A., then to Johns Hopkins for a Ph.D. in international relations. In 1988, he resigned from HHI to enter politics but has remained the company's largest individual shareholder. (His billionaire brother, Chung Mong-Koo, is chairman of Hyundai Motor Co.) Now in his seventh term as a member of the National Assembly of South Korea, he represents Ulsan, the seat of the Hyundai empire. Drawing on his practical experience in business and his expertise in government policy, Chung wrote ""The Government-Business Relationship of Japan: A Case Study of the Japanese Automobile Industry."" Published in 1993, the book explored the role of government in industrial development, offering insights for politicians and business leaders seeking to join the ranks of more developed nations. In 2014, he won the nomination of the conservative Saenuri party to run for mayor of Seoul. His prescriptions for economic development and making Seoul a more attractive place to live, however, were not enough to overcome incumbent Park Won-Soon at the ballot box. An avid sportsman, Chung, as vice president of soccer's world governing body, FIFA, was instrumental in securing South Korea's selection as co-host of the 2002 World Cup.

Family members later expanded to sheet-metal piggy banks, telephones and cash registers. Horst joined the family business, then run by his two uncles, in 1952 at age 19. He pressed for the aging business to think about entering new markets. Six years later, the company brought the hula hoop to Europe. The oil crisis of the 1970s made plastic scarce, and Brandstaetter asked a top lieutenant to develop a new toy that wouldn't require much of it. Together, he and that employee dreamed up the little figurines with hollow body parts that used less plastic. They hit toy store shelves in 1974.

By then, Taekwang Group was emerging as a pint-size version of the far-flung, family-run conglomerates known as chaebol. Its most important asset: Heungkuk Life Insurance Co., Ltd., which today accounts for over 80% of Lee's estimated net worth. More-glamorous assets were added to the mix, including golf courses and cable TV. In 2008, the group acquired cable TV firm Qrix Communication and merged it with its own company Tbroad to create Korea's largest cable business. Two years earlier, regulators had denied Taekwang permission to buy Qrix. Then investigators began probing and reports emerged of improprieties in lobbying government officials to help expand Taekwang's business empire. In 2012, Lee was handed a four-and-a-half year prison sentence and fined $1.8 million for having embezzled around $19 million through accounting maneuvers and causing some $270 million in damage to Taekwang by selling its golf courses at below-market prices and extending loans to affiliates without collateral. Suffering from liver cancer, he was granted bail in June 2013 and has not been sent back to prison. His 82-year-old mother was sentenced to four years in prison and fined $1.8 million on the same charges.

The transaction raised eyebrows in part because Brazil's central bank treated Macedo as a foreign investor since he is based in the U.S. The bulk of Macedo's fortune stems from his ownership of Rede Record, Brazil's second-largest broadcaster, which he acquired in 1990 from entertainer Silvio Santos. It's unclear how he got the funding to purchase the company: Brazil's Public Ministry has probed into the question for more than ten years while some reports have alleged that he used church funds.

Sankai founded the firm in 2004 after years of tinkering with its key product: the Robot Suit HAL (Hybrid Assistive Limb) whose robot arms and legs take over when our own fail through age or physical impairment. In Japan the company rents HAL suits to hospitals and nursing homes; they read electrical pulses in patients' nerves, and offer the potential to restore muscle movement. About 470 suits in all are currently being used in medical and non-medical facilities. Sankai is bullish on this new field of ""cybernics,"" a multidisciplinary academic area which combines bionics, electronics and physics to create robot parts for the body.

In 2014, the self-made billionaire introduced slimming denim to a line of products that started with footless pantyhose and now includes everything from bras to yoga apparel. The company underwent some upheaval this past year when longtime CEO Laurie Ann Goldman parted ways with the company; former Nike apparel exec Jan Singer has since come on board in the top role. Blakely has come a long way since age 29, when she invested her $5,000 life savings trying to come up with something flattering to wear under her white slacks. Six months later the one-time Disney World ride greeter and door-to-door fax machine salesperson found her new line of shaping underwear named one of Oprah Winfrey's Favorite Things. She still owns 100% of the company, which remains staunchly private despite persistent IPO rumors.
