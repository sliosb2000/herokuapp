Hong is an arts graduate of Seoul National University, and both museums contain collections from her father-in-law, Samsung founder Lee Byung-Chull. Leeum comes from Lee's name and the last syllable of ""museum""; Ho-Am, the patriarch's pen name, means ""lake rock,"" for his breadth and strength. Her husband suffered a heart attack in 2014 and was in a coma before his death. Hong's only son and heir to the country's largest conglomerate was indicted and jailed on bribery charges in February 2017, before being released the following year. He denies any wrongdoing. Hong's daughters are also billionaires: Lee Seo-hyun now heads the advisory board at The Leeum, while Lee Boo-jin, CEO of Hotel Shilla, oversees resort, theme park and construction activities. Hong's father was chairman of one of Korea's largest-circulation daily newspapers, JoongAng Ilbo. One of her brothers then took over and now his son runs it. Another brother, Hong Seok-joh, runs the country's biggest convenience-store chain and is also a billionaire. Although not involved in Samsung's management, Hong gets her fortune from her stake in Samsung Electronics. She is known for being a prolific buyer of art.",,,,,,,
