Gates recruited the likes of Mark Zuckerberg, Chinese e-commerce billionaire Jack Ma, and Aliko Dangote, Africa's richest man, to join the coalition.

Unlike Trump, Buffett does not think America needs to be made great again. ""The babies being born in America today are the luckiest crop in history,"" he wrote in his annual letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders. ""For 240 years it's been a terrible mistake to bet against America, and now is no time to start."" Such optimism makes sense coming from one of the most successful investors in history. Shares of Berkshire Hathaway remain near all-time highs. One investment not doing well: Wells Fargo. The company, in which Berkshire has a 10% stake, is mired in scandal for creating 2 million accounts for customers without their permission. Berkshire also has stakes in American Express and Coca-Cola and owns Geico, Dairy Queen and Fruit of the Loom. In July 2016 Buffett gave away nearly $2.9 billion in Berkshire stock to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and his family members' foundations, in what has become his annual summer gift.

After World War II, he and his brother Theo Albrecht, who died in 2010 at the age of 88, took over their family's corner grocery store in Essen, Germany and propagated the discount revolution in German retailing. They built their Aldi supermarket chain based on a no-frills, low-price strategy similar to Wal-Mart. In 1961, the brothers split ownership: Karl Sr. took the stores in southern Germany, plus the rights to the Aldi brand in the U.K., Australia and the U.S., while Theo Sr. got the stores in northern Germany and the rest of Europe. Later, in 1971, Theo Sr. bought U.S. grocery chain Trader Joe's. Karl Sr. resigned from the operational business of Aldi Sued in 1994, and stepped down from its advisory board in 2002. His wife, ""Mia"" (Maria) Albrecht, died in 2013 at age 89. The capital of Aldi Sued mostly resides in a family foundation, the Siepmann Stiftung (formed in 1973 using the maiden name of Karl and Theo's mother). Beate Heister has never worked at Aldi Sued but sits, together with her husband Peter and her son Peter Max Heister (one of six children), on its advisory board.

The son of a newspaper publisher, Knight ran track at the University of Oregon before going to business school at Stanford. He graduated with an MBA and decided to travel the world. While abroad, Knight talked his way into meetings with Japanese shoe suppliers. Back home, he and his old track coach Bill Bowerman each put up $500 to start a company called Blue Ribbon Sports.

A trained economist with an M.B.A., Klatten is credited with helping transform Altana AG, based in the German town of Wesel on the Lower Rhine, into a world-class pharmaceutical/specialty chemical corporation. She inherited 50% of the company, which has been a phenomenal moneymaker and currently derives about 85% of its $2 billion in annual sales from foreign customers. After it sold its pharmaceutical business, best known for the blockbuster ulcer drug Pantoprazol, to Scandinavian firm Nycomed for around $6 billion in 2006, she received roughly half of the proceeds in the form of a special dividend. Having since taken the company private, she currently owns 100% and serves as co-Deputy Chairperson of the Supervisory Board. She also holds stakes in wind power outfit Nordex AG, soil additive company Geohumus and carbon and graphite producer SGL Group, where she became Chairperson of the Supervisory Board in 2013.

38,Billionaires,2016,3,georg-schaeffler,"Georg Schaeffler and his mother, Maria-Elisabeth Schaeffler-Thumann, are the proprietors of Schaeffler Group, one of the world's largest producers of ball bearings and machine components. Schaeffler's history begins with the purchase of 67% Davistan AG in 1939 or 1940 (historical reports vary) by Wilhelm Schaeffler (Maria-Elisabeth's brother-in-law). The producer of sheepskin, plush and rugs had fallen into the hands of a banking syndicate after the Jewish owners fled the country as the Nazis rose to power. Using forced labor, the company produced textiles for the German army (Wehrmacht) and starting in 1941, needle bearings for tanks. In 1946, Wilhelm and his brother Georg (Maria-Elisabeth's husband), both holders of Ph.D. degrees, founded the manufacturer that became known as INA, which initially only produced wooden buttons and belt buckles. The ball bearing assembly known as the needle cage, which became the foundation for the company's success, was developed by Georg Schaeffler in 1949. Maria-Elisabeth took over in 1996, following the death of Georg (Wilhelm Schaeffler died in 1981). Her son (also named Georg), who served two years in the German armed forces, worked for Schaeffler Group from 1990 to 1996. Following his father's death, Georg studied law in the U.S and wound up practicing international business law in Dallas. (His younger brother Christian died from an electric shock in 1975, after a hair dryer fell into the bathtub.) In 2008, Schaeffler Group announced a $15-billion, debt-financed takeover of publicly traded tire and auto parts giant Continental AG. Georg joined his mother in running Schaeffler in 2009. For a while, in the wake of the worldwide financial crisis, it looked as if the high-wire act might all come crashing down. But as the auto market rebounded, the Schaefflers continued to pay down debt via Continental share sales and excess cash flow. Between February 1, 2009 and November 1, 2015, Continental's share price rose over 20-fold. Through Schaeffler Group and its parent, Schaeffler Verwaltungs GmbH, Georg and Maria-Elisabeth now own 46% of Continental.

With its shares slumping, Perelman submitted a filing to the SEC in January 2016 that signaled he might explore a sale or some other transaction. He first took over Revlon in a leveraged buyout in 1985 and tried to take it private once before, back in 2009. Along with figures like Carl Icahn and George Soros, Perelman came to be emblematic of the Wall Street deal craze of the 1980s, in which more debt fueled increasingly larger takeovers. Perelman used some of the proceeds from his deals to buy a great deal of art; his collection is conservatively worth $4 billion. He's also been active in philanthropy--donating $50 million to New York Presbyterian Hospital in 2010 and $25 million to his alma mater, the University of Pennsylvania, in 2013.

At SpaceX, a literal moonshot, he's trying to revolutionize space tech to enable people to live on other planets. Musk's meteoric rise has been anything but smooth, though. In June 2015 one of SpaceX's Falcon 9 rockets exploded two minutes after launch, resulting in a total loss. Six months later a Falcon 9 rocket was able to successfully land upright after visiting space, but when SpaceX tried to land a rocket on a floating ocean barge in January 2016, one of its legs didn't lock and the rocket tipped over and exploded. Still, the company has a $1.6 billion contract with NASA to resupply the International Space Station, and funding rounds have valued the company north of $10 billion. Back on the ground, Tesla is following up its smash-hit Model S sedan with an electric SUV, the Model X. Deliveries are expected to begin in the second half of 2016. The South African-born Musk emigrated to Canada at age 17 and then to the U.S. as a transfer student to the University of Pennsylvania. He made his first fortune as a cofounder of Paypal. He's also the chairman of SolarCity, the publicly-traded solar panel designer and installer run by his cousin, Lyndon Rive. In 2013 Musk unveiled the Hyperloop, a design for a high-speed transportation system that would send riders through tubes in pods.

In 1972, Tschira and four colleagues left IBM to found German software company SAP (Systems, Applications, Products), which went public in 1988. Tschira retired from the company in 1998, and stepped down from its supervisory board in 2007. SAP has over 74,000 employees worldwide and generates annual revenue in excess of $21 billion. For many years in its estimate of Tschira's net worth, Forbes excluded the value of SAP shares held by his charitable foundation, believing them to be irrevocably owned and controlled by a charity. It turned out that the foundation, founded in 1995, is a limited liability company with a charitable purpose, over which the Tschira family (under the legal umbrella of the Klaus Tschira Community of Heirs) has full control. The Klaus Tschira Stiftung (KTS) -- located at the Villa Bosch in Heidelberg, Germany, the former residence of Nobel Prize Laureate for chemistry Carl Bosch -- will maintain its name in Klaus Tschira's memory.

The empire has been riding several powerful waves: public interest in environmentally friendly products formulated from natural ingredients; the rising purchasing power and mobility of Chinese consumers; and the ""K-beauty"" phenomenon -- the global interest in Korean beauty products and techniques, which is closely tied to the cultural trend known as Hallyu, or the Korean Wave, fueled by the surging popularity of Korean pop (""K-pop"") media content. AmorePacific traces its roots to the 1930s, when Suh's grandmother ""scattered the seeds of beauty"" by making camellia-based hair oils and creams as a sideline. His father, Sun Sung-Whan, took over the business in 1943 and ran it for more than five decades. The only one of six children to take an interest in the business, Kyung-Bae, who grew up next door to the company's headquarters, joined AmorePacific in the 1980s after earning an M.B.A. from Cornell University. Elevated to chief executive in 1997, he quickly expanded into overseas markets while investing heavily in dermatology research. Many of its products contain ingredients such as ginseng, soybean and green tea. Its luxury herbal cosmetic Sulhwasoo grew out of research into Oriental medicinal herbs. Its ""deep seawater"" cosmetic, Lirikos, is popular with Chinese consumers. In 2000, AmorePacific set up a breast cancer foundation. For more than a decade, it has supported the Korea's Pink Ribbon Love Marathon to help breast cancer victims. In 2010, Suh Kyung-Bae received an award from Ernst & Young naming him Korea's best CEO.

Uber is competing with taxi services in the United States and 59 other countries around the world. The company has been tearing across the globe, pledging to pour $1 billion each into China and India as it tries to unseat strong local players and encountering bans and regulatory obstacles in Europe. In January 2016, Uber in China raised funding that valued it at $7 billion. At times controversial, Uber has faced questions about how it treats its drivers -- whether they are employees or independent contractors -  and about whether its riders are truly safe.

249,Billionaires,2016,3,ray-lee-hunt,"Ray Hunt and son Hunter have been facing some pushback over their plan to acquire control of Oncor, the Texas electricity distribution division of bankrupt Energy Future Holdings, which K.K.R. took over in a $45 billion LBO in 2007. If the Hunts' $19 billion plan (backed by a consortium of hedge funds) does go through, they would convert Oncor into a real estate investment trust. To prove it could be done, the Hunts last year did an IPO of their existing power generation assets into the first-ever electric REIT called InfraREIT. It's a bit of a departure for this oil-soaked family. Ray looks to be the most successful of 14 children sired by legendary oil wildcatter H.L. Hunt. But it wasn't always that way. Half brothers Herbert and Nelson Bunker Hunt (d. 2014) were worth more than $10 billion in the late 1970s when they tried to corner the market in silver. Ray has been a little more careful. His trophy assets include the iconic Reunion Tower and the shiny new headquarters of Hunt Consolidated in Dallas. Like his father, Hunt is deep into the oil business; Hunt Oil is one of the largest privately held oil companies in the nation. In 2014, for $280 million, Hunt Oil sold its stake in the East Texas oil field, including the legendary wells H.L. bought in the 1930s from wildcatter Marion ""Dad"" Joiner. Turned out to be great timing, considering how oil prices have fallen since then. Overseas, Hunt was one of the first U.S. oil companies after the toppling of Saddam Hussein to land an oil exploration deal in the Kurdish region of Iraq. He's also leveraged his big balance sheet to partner on liquefied natural gas plants in Peru and Yemen (though terrorist attacks have plagued the latter project). Torch passing is underway: son Hunter Hunt, the second of his five children, is chief executive of Hunt Consolidated Energy; Ray remains chairman and CEO of Hunt Consolidated.

His Chief Oil & Gas is focused on natural gas, so he's already had three years to learn how to deal with low prices. On the contrary, all the new opportunities to buy up oil fields on the cheap have him ""licking my chops."" Rees-Jones got his start as a bankruptcy attorney, but one day he had a revelation: he wanted to be the guy making the deals, not the lawyer cleaning up after them. So in 1984 he decided to get in the oil business, and eventually became a shale fracking pioneer. His Chief Oil & Gas' first success was in the Barnett shale of Fort Worth, where in 2006 he and his partners sold a bunch of land, wells and pipelines to Devon and Crosstex for $2.6 billion. Next came a JV with Ross Perot, Jr. which they sold to Quicksilver in 2008. He plowed that cash into the Marcellus shale of Pennsylvania. Within a couple years he cleared $2 billion more selling acreage to the likes of Chevron, and another $1 billion dealing his Marcellus pipeline network to Penn-Virginia in 2012. He hasn't left that play yet; after buying $500 million worth of land and wells from Chesapeake Energy in 2013, Chief now operates 210,000 acres pumping out roughly 800 million cubic feet of natural gas per day. Generous to Dallas charities his Rees-Jones Foundation has given away some $300 million, including $25 million each to the new Museum of Nature & Science and Boy Scouts, $19 million to establish the Rees-Jones Center for Foster Care Excellence at the Children's Medical Center and $2 million to Mercy Ships, which builds floating super-hospitals.

267,Billionaires,2016,3,ludwig-merckle,"After the death of Adolf Merckle in 2009 at the age of 74, his son Ludwig, now 50, took the helm of an empire mired in crisis and debt. The downward spiral had come about unexpectedly, after secretive Adolf took a hit in the 2008 financial crisis. He'd taken out a loan to recapitalize HeidelbergCement, and used shares he owned in the company as collateral. After Heidelberg stock lost 75% of its value and banks demanded early repayment of the loan and additional collateral, Adolf committed suicide. Subsequently, Ludwig has restructured the group and executed an impressive turnaround. In the fall of 2009, he cut his stake in HeidelbergCement from 74% to 25%. The following year, he sold generic drug maker Ratiopharm to Teva Pharmaceuticals for $5 billion. It looked as if Phoenix Pharma Group might have to go on the block as well, given the extent of the liabilities Adolf had assumed in assembling the drug wholesaler through acquisitions, but the company was saved when banks came through with a syndicated loan facility. Now Phoenix, which also operates more than 1,580 retail pharmacies in 12 countries (many under the brand name BENU), is deleveraging and turning increasing profits. Merckle also owns the snowcat maker Kaessbohrer and 50% of a private engine manufacturer, Zollern. He once said that he wished to maintain as much as possible of his father's ""achievements."" He's already done an admirable job, and may yet get some additional satisfaction from a pending lawsuit against Porsche. Merckle Group is seeking damages of Eu 231 million ($277 million), alleging that Porsche wrongfully manipulated the share price of Volkswagen in 2008 and thereby caused a ""short squeeze,"" torpedoing a bet by Adolf Merckle that shares of the automaker would fall.

After selling clothes for more than a decade, he opened the first Massa department store in 1965. He sold the chain in 1985, but smartly held on to the underlying property. Under a 30-year lease deal with retailer Metro, he has collected Eu 52.66 million ($63 million) a year in rent. Kipp has divested most if not all of his commercial real estate holdings in the U.S., notably 950 Third Avenue and other high-end office properties in Manhattan. These days, he tends to his Swiss luxury hotel and resort group, which he regards as a passionate hobby and not a source of income. He has three five-star properties: the Tschuggen Grand Hotel in Arosa, where he lives with his wife, Hannelore; the all-suite Carlton Hotel in St. Moritz; and the Hotel Eden Roc in Ascona, named hotel of the year in 2014 by the prestigious Gault&Millau ratings guide. His Hotel Valsana in Arosa, a four-star property, is undergoing a complete renovation through 2017. Kipp maintains high standards for his hotels -- commissioning luminaries like Mario Botta, a top Swiss-Italian architect who restored Milan's La Scala, to upgrade design elements including a wellness ""temple"" now famous in the Alps. Back in May 2002, Kipp gave his first interview in 15 years to the Swiss magazine Bilanz. When asked what he thought of Forbes's calculation of his wealth, he replied: ""That's a worth question, anyone can come around and count for a couple of weeks.

279,Billionaires,2016,3,willi-isolde-liebherr,"Willi and Isolde Liebherr's father was one of the most revered industrialists of post-World War II Germany. Hans Liebherr recognized the need for machinery to rebuild his country while managing his parents' construction firm. With the introduction, in 1949, of the first mobile tower crane, Hans Liebherr Maschinenfabrik (Engineering Works) was born, in Kirchdorf. After unveiling the first hydraulic excavator in Europe, in 1953, Hans branched out into appliances, aerospace components and systems, concrete mixers, machine tools, material-handling equipment, diesel engines and climate-control technology. When Hans died in 1993, at age 78, his company had become one of the largest equipment manufacturers in the world. Management control then passed to Willi -- who joined the business in 1971, after earning a mechanical engineering degree from the Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich -- and his sister, Isolde, who joined the business in 1976 after earning a degree in management from the Business School of Mannheim (Germany). They continued to expand the business and eventually, their children assumed management positions within the company. Willi's son Jan shares management responsibility with his father for separate divisions focused on earthmoving machinery and components (diesel and gas engines, fuel-injection systems, hydraulic cylinders, gearboxes, winches, etc.), while sister Sophie Albrecht likewise shares management responsibility with Willi for the mobile cranes and mining divisions (the latter includes equipment such as hydraulic excavators weighing up to 880 tons). Isolde's daughter St√©fanie Wohlfarth shares management duties with her mother for the appliances division and her uncle Willi for the tower cranes company area. Sister Patricia Ruef presides over the maritime cranes division with her mother, while also sharing responsibility with Willi for the machine tools and automation systems division. Today, the $9.6 billion (2014 revenue) Liebherr Group, which also owns six luxury hotels in Ireland, Austria and Germany, employs more than 40,800 people in over 130 companies at sites on every continent (aside from Antarctica).

""No matter where in the world a car door is opened, a window regulator operated, a car seat adjusted or the air conditioning turned on -- you will almost always find our technology in use,"" according to the company's website. ""At least every third vehicle on the road today is equipped with one or more Brose products."" Approximately 24,000 employees work for the company at 60 locations in 23 countries. Annual revenues top $5.7 billion. At the end of 2005, Stoschek withdrew from operational management and became chairman of Brose Group.

Schaeffler's history begins with the purchase of 67% Davistan AG in 1939 or 1940 (historical reports vary) by Wilhelm Schaeffler (Maria-Elisabeth's brother-in-law). The producer of sheepskin, plush and rugs had fallen into the hands of a banking syndicate after the Jewish owners fled the country as the Nazis rose to power. Using forced labor, the company produced textiles for the German army (Wehrmacht) and starting in 1941, needle bearings for tanks. In 1946, Wilhelm and his brother Georg (Maria-Elisabeth's husband), both holders of Ph.D. degrees, founded the manufacturer that became known as INA, which initially only produced wooden buttons and belt buckles. The ball bearing assembly known as the needle cage, which became the foundation for the company's success, was developed by Georg Schaeffler in 1949. Maria-Elisabeth took over in 1996, following the death of Georg (Wilhelm Schaeffler died in 1981). In 2008, Schaeffler Group announced a $15-billion, debt-financed takeover of publicly traded tire and auto parts giant Continental AG. Her son (also named Georg), who had been practicing international business law in Dallas, joined her in running Schaeffler in 2009. For a while, in the wake of the ensuing worldwide financial crisis, it looked as if the high-wire act might all come crashing down. But as the auto market rebounded, the Schaefflers continued to pay down debt via Continental share sales and excess cash flow. Between February 1, 2009 and November 1, 2015, Continental's share price rose over 20-fold. Through Schaeffler Group and its parent, Schaeffler Verwaltungs GmbH, Georg and Maria-Elisabeth now own 46% of Continental. Maria-Elisabeth has received various accolades for her entrepreneurial and civic achievements, as well as for her commitment to social issues and cultural organizations.

Taking what they learned at their dad's real estate company, they jumped into the takeover game by focusing on tax avoidance and cash flow. They acquired their first company in 1981, a vinyl-siding manufacturer called Master Shield. It threw off enough cash to finance further acquisitions. One, in 1983, was a crippled REIT they renamed Danaher after a Montana stream where they once fished for trout. The brothers merged their profitable acquisitions into the loss-making REIT, using it as a shield against taxes. They survived the financial crises in the 80s and 90s and prospered, always searching for their next bounty.

Fourteen months later RG filed for bankruptcy and laid off 4,000 workers. In January 2013 RG's creditors sued, accusing Rennert of delaying bankruptcy proceedings for personal gain, but the creditors withdrew the suit the next month.

In 2004 he sold a majority stake to billionaire Ronald Perelman's MacAndrews & Forbes for $930 million. Renco's holdings include the Doe Run Company, a mining outfit in Peru that is the subject of a long-running pollution suit.

One of Stine's current projects is gaining traction with corn growers and could revolutionize the corn industry: seeds bred to thrive when they are densely planted, dramatically increasing harvests. Farmers planted 140,000 acres of the corn in 2015. Stine grew up the son of a hardscrabble farmer and began dabbling in seed breeding in the 1960s. Dyslexic and mildly autistic, but a math and data wiz, Stine quietly built some of the most genetically robust and highest-yielding soybean seeds in the industry. He was one of the first to patent the genetics of the soybean in the early 1990s and, as a savvy businessman and formidable negotiator, landed lucrative deals licensing the genetics to industry heavyweights. Stine Seed still reaps millions of dollars annually from these contracts. It also develops biotechnology traits, which are often applied to seeds to make them pesticide-resistant. Stine owns a small home a couple hundred yards from work and drives a Ford F-150 pickup truck to the Stine Seed headquarters, where his four children work as well.

Upon his death in 1985, she assumed control of a juggernaut that currently publishes newspapers in 44 countries, including the leading German conservative daily, Die Welt, and Germany's largest tabloid, Bild Zeitung.

The company plans to mesh Die Welt with N24 to create the leading multimedia news outlet for quality journalism in the German-speaking world. At the same time, N24 becomes the central video provider for all Axel Springer brands. Meanwhile, Axel Springer sold its regional newspapers, TV program guides and women's magazines in Germany to Funke Mediengruppe.

The very first Media Markt opened its doors that year in an industrial park in Munich, with the aim of offering a broad selection of brand products at permanently low prices. In 1988, the founders sold a 54% stake to Kaufhof, which later merged with retail giant Metro. In January 2013, Metro purchased 3% held by cofounder Stiefel for about $310 million, thus valuing the entire company at about $10.5 billion (7.7 billion euros). The acquisition raised Metro's stake in the company to more than 78%. Still holding close to 22% and maintaining veto rights, Kellerhals had a strained relationship with Metro for years. He has even taken a tussle concerning the company's governance to German courts. As of February 2016, the parties had not reached final agreement over the dispute. In January, Kellerhals' investment firm Convergenta called for top Media-Saturn executives to step down.

His career took a turn in 1970, when he left Campbell's for a small pet food company called Iams, which at the time had five employees. In 1975, Mathile bought 50% of the business for $100,000 from founder Paul Iams, signing the deal on a one-page piece of paper. Six years later, Mathile bought the remainder, agreeing to pay Paul Iams $100,000 a year for perpetuity and buy him a new Cadillac.

In an unusual move, shortly before Arista's IPO in 2014, cofounder David Cheriton's firm OptumSoft sued Arista, accusing it of violating the terms of a licensing agreement. A judge rejected those claims in December 2015. A second phase of the suit, regarding OptumSoft's claims that Arista misappropriated trade secrets, will go to trial in April 2016. Cisco, the cofounders' ex-employer, has also accused Arista of patent infringement in two federal lawsuits; Arista filed a counterclaim alleging antitrust and unfair competition in one of the suits, and a trial will begin in November 2016. Cisco also filed two patent infringement complaints against Arista with the International Trade Commission. An initial decision in one investigation in February 2016 determined that two software features infringed on patents, but found no violations on two others. Arista denies that there were any violations. Born in Germany, Von Bechtolsheim studied computer engineering at Carnegie Mellon University and landed at Stanford for his Ph.D. He cofounded technology hardware firm Sun Microsystems, which was acquired by Oracle in 2010.

In September 2016 the Securities & Exchange Commission charged Cooperman and his Omega Advisors hedge fund firm with insider trading. Cooperman claims the charges are without merit. Federal prosecutors are awaiting the outcome of a closely-watched Supreme Court case before making a decision on their insider-trading investigation of Cooperman. After a bad start to 2016, Cooperman has recovered a lot of lost ground as he looks to avoid his third down year in a row. After being down as much as 10% to open 2016, Omega was up on the year by September, led by a recovery in its holding of collateralized loan obligations, gains on stocks like Chimera Investment Group and Ashland, and a bottoming in financial sector investments such as First Data and AIG. Still, as of August, $5.5 billion Omega Advisors had lost $1.2 billion assets in 2016 and Cooperman's personal investment in the hedge fund continues to grow as a percentage of overall assets. Cooperman grew up in the South Bronx, where his parents landed after fleeing Poland. He became the first in his family to attend college; he studied chemistry at Hunter College. After graduating from Columbia Business School, Cooperman made a name for himself at Goldman Sachs, where he headed the firm's research department and eventually led its asset management division, GSAM.

569,Billionaires,2016,3,chey-tae-won,"SK Group Chairman Chey Tae-Won was serving a four-year prison term before being pardoned by Korean President Park Geun-Hye in August 2015. He had been found guilty of embezzling nearly $47 million from two SK affiliates and diverting the funds to personal wagers on stock futures and options in 2008. Back in 2003, Chey spent seven months in prison for accounting irregularities; returning to SK after his release, he was pardoned in 2008. These troubles seem to belie his pedigree. He has a B.A. in physics from Korea University and a Ph.D. in economics from the University of Chicago; taught at Seoul National University; was a regular attendee at the World Economic Forum in Davos; and earned accolades for leading SK to undisputed success. Key segments for SK Group include telecommunications, IT services and semiconductors and digital storage solutions; chemicals, energy and biopharmaceuticals; and the development and construction of plants and major infrastructure products. Most of Chey's wealth is derived from a 23% stake in SK Holdings, which owns pieces of various SK affiliates and provides consulting and IT services to them and other customers. The company received a big vote of confidence in 2014 when Taiwanese contract manufacturing giant Foxconn (a k a Hon Hai Precision Industry), the major supplier of iPhones and iPads, purchased a 4.9% stake for $377 million. The seller of the shares was Chey. In late 2015, he made news by revealing, in a letter written to the Korean daily Segye Ilbo, that he'd fathered a child with another woman and would seek to divorce his wife, Roh Soh-Yeong, daughter of Korea's former president Roh Tae-Woo. In conclusion, Chey wrote that he would ""put away all anxiety"" regarding his misdeeds and direct all his energy toward serving customers, clients, shareholders, partnering firms and the South Korean economy.

Hyundai is the world's fifth-largest automaker, having sold (along with its Kia Motors Corp. affiliate) more than eight million vehicles in 2014.

As president of Kia from 2005 to 2009, he made over the company's brand image, hiring renowned automotive designer Peter Schreyer to phase out the bland, boxy styling that had made Kia models such as the Soul objects of derision among auto buffs. During his tenure at the helm, Kia grew faster than its Hyundai Motor affiliate--allowing Chung to begin to step outside the shadow cast by his formidable father, who is known for his obsession with quality and hard-charging management style. In 2009 Chung became vice chairman of Hyundai Motor. He was appointed to the company's board in 2010, bringing him a step closer to becoming the third generation of his family to lead Hyundai. In November 2015, appropriating the name of the company's full-size sedan, he announced ""a new beginning for Hyundai Motor"" with the launch of a global luxury brand, Genesis. While his father derives most of his wealth from his stake in Hyundai Motor, Hyundai Glovis Co. -- which functions as a holding company for stakes in Hyundai affiliates and also provides logistics services to those affiliates and other customers -- accounts for most of Eui-Sun's fortune.

In June 2016, he appointed her the head of Sonangol, Angola's state oil firm. Her assets in Angola include 25% of Unitel, the country's largest mobile phone network, and 42% of a bank, Banco BIC.

In June 2015, media reported that she spent slightly more than $200 million to buy a stake in Portuguese electric power equipment firm Efacec Power Solutions.

618,Billionaires,2016,3,daniela-herz,"Daniela Herz-Schnoeckel is the only daughter of coffee magnate Max Herz and his wife, Ingeburg. After Max died in 1965, her brother Guenter grabbed the reins of the family business and built upon Max's idea of opening stores where coffee could be both sipped and sold over the counter -- a forerunner to Starbucks. (Ingeburg died in September 2015). Guenter ran the business for almost 35 years, building Tchibo into a retailing force by adding a wide range of other consumer goods and services. A family feud heated up after he advanced a plan to take the company public to finance acquisitions and fortify itself against deep-pocketed competitors. In 2003, Daniela and he sold their combined 40% interest in the family holding company -- which included a stake in skin-care products maker Beiersdorf, whose brands include Nivea -- for an estimated $5 billion. They plowed a chunk of those funds into private equity firm Mayfair SE, which, in 2006, acquired shipping classification company Germanischer Lloyd. In December 2012, the company agreed to merge with Det Norske Veritas of Norway.

619,Billionaires,2016,3,guenter-herz,"After the death of his father Max in 1965, Guenter Herz, at age 24, grabbed the reins of his family's coffee business and built upon Max's idea of opening stores where coffee could be both sipped and sold over the counter -- a forerunner to Starbucks. Guenter ran the business for almost 35 years, building Tchibo into a retailing force by adding a wide range of other consumer goods and services. A family feud heated up after he advanced a plan to take the company public to finance acquisitions and fortify itself against deep-pocketed competitors. In 2003, sister Daniela and he sold their combined 40% interest in the family holding company -- which included a stake in skin-care products maker Beiersdorf, whose brands include Nivea -- for an estimated $5 billion. They plowed a chunk of those funds into private equity firm Mayfair SE, which, in 2006, acquired shipping classification company Germanischer Lloyd. In December 2012, the company agreed to merge with Det Norske Veritas of Norway.

Yvonne's father, Heinz Heinrich Bauer, began the company's international expansion with the 1981 launch of the first weekly women's magazine in the U.S., Woman's World. (Other Bauer titles include In Touch and First for Women.) Today, Bauer -- Europe's largest magazine publisher, focused primarily on a female demographic -- has a presence in more than 20 countries, with approximately 10,000 employees on its payroll and annual revenues exceeding $2.4 billion, approximately two-thirds of which are derived from markets outside of Germany. Yvonne Bauer studied German philology at the University of Bamberg and went on to apprentice at the publishing house Hoffmann und Campe, before starting her career at Bauer in 2005. She took the reins in 2010, after her father transferred 85% of the business to her. She is the second-youngest of four daughters: sisters Mirja, Nicola and Saskia also work at Bauer, with each owning 5% of the group.  Although ""We think popular"" is the company's tag line, reflecting its passion for interpreting popular culture, Yvonne can be outspoken on weighty issues such as press freedom. ""To preserve this freedom and ensure that we will remain free to choose what we want to read in the future,"" she declared in a note on Bauer Media Group's home page, ""we will have to interact with one another in a tolerant and open-minded fashion. By endorsing this campaign in our magazines, we are putting down a clear marker in support of freedom of the press and freedom of expression.""

Philip is the oldest of Stavros' four children with Eugenia Livianos, and he inherited the bulk of his father's art collection. Bought in 1957 for $3 million from actor Edward Robinson, who needed to pay for his divorce, the Niarchos family collection includes some of the world's most recognizable pieces.  It is said to be the largest private collection of works by Van Gogh, including a self portrait of the Dutch master after having chopped off his own ear. The collection also includes one of the most iconic works by Spanish artist Pablo Picasso, ""Yo, Picasso.""  The collection has grown under Philip, who added various post-war and contemporary works, including pieces by Andy Warhol and Maurizio Cattelan.  Philip is credited by some as having put Haitian-American artist Jean-Michel Basquiat in the category of absolute masters after buying a self-portrait for a then-record $3.3 million in 1982.

His latest move: casting off 235 stores into a new, publicly traded real estate investment trust called Seritage Growth Properties. The $2.7 billion transaction bolstered Sears' bottom line and produced the first quarterly profit in Lampert's tenure as CEO. But the news was overshadowed by an 11% decline in same-store sales, and investors dumped the stock once again. Lampert helped create today's Sears by merging Kmart and Sears Roebuck in 2005. Revenues have declined every year since 2006. A lawyer's son, Lampert read corporate reports and financial textbooks in high school before heading to Yale, where he was a member of Skull & Bones.

After World War II, his grandson Rudolf August Oetker, a former Nazi SS officer, quickly rose to prominence as the driving force behind one of Germany's most recognizable brands. In 1950, according to the family history ""Die Oetkers,"" Oetker produced more than 750 million packages of baking and pudding powder. Personifying Germany's Wirtschaftswunder, or economic miracle, he developed additional food products and expanded into beverages, container shipping, financial services and luxury hotels. He died in 2007, at age 90, leaving eight children from three marriages. The heirs, who along with their families each own 12.5% percent of the conglomerate, have disagreed over the management and future direction of Oetker, however. Split into two camps, the rivalry is between the children from Rudolf August's first two marriages -- Bergit Douglas and Rosely Schweizer, plus Richard, Christian and August Oetker -- and the siblings from the third marriage: Alfred, Carl Ferdinand and Julia Oetker. Alfred was expected to take over as general partner from his half-brother August in 2010, but he was blocked by the older siblings, who instead crowned Richard Oetker. In January 2015, with a proxy fight pending before an arbitration tribunal, the groups agreed to recruit an outside CEO when Richard retires in 2017.

Now broadly diversified, Dr August Oetker KG -- a holding company whose subsidiaries employ some 26,000 people and generate around $15 billion in annual revenue -- traces its roots 1891, when August Oetker, a pharmacist, started selling non-perishable baking powder. After World War II, his grandson Rudolf August Oetker, a former Nazi SS officer, quickly rose to prominence as the driving force behind one of Germany's most recognizable brands. In 1950, according to the family history ""Die Oetkers,"" Oetker produced more than 750 million packages of baking and pudding powder. Personifying Germany's Wirtschaftswunder, or economic miracle, he developed additional food products and expanded into beverages, container shipping, financial services and luxury hotels. He died in 2007, at age 90, leaving eight children from three marriages. The heirs, who along with their families each own 12.5% percent of the conglomerate, have disagreed over the management and future direction of Oetker, however. Split into two camps, the rivalry is between the children from Rudolf August's first two marriages -- Rosely Schweizer and Bergit Graefin Douglas, plus Richard, Christian and August Oetker -- and the siblings from the third marriage: Alfred, Carl Ferdinand and Julia Oetker. Alfred was expected to take over as general partner from his half-brother August in 2010, but he was blocked by the older siblings, who instead crowned Richard Oetker. In January 2015, with a proxy fight pending before an arbitration tribunal, the groups agreed to recruit an outside CEO when Richard retires in 2017. Rosely Schweizer studied economics in Innsbruck, Austria, worked at the family's sparkling wine and spirits company Henkell & Soehnlein, and served as the conglomerate's advisory board chairwoman until 2010.

Doris was born in the small town of Tombolo, outside Padua in northeastern Italy, spending days without food due to his family's precarious situation. With financial support from his sister, a seamstress, he completed his studies and went on to work in the financial industry, first selling insurance policies. As his career progressed, his ambition grew, and he felt the entrepreneurial itch. Hearing Silvio Berlusconi publicly say, ""if anyone has an idea and needs an investor, come find me; if it's a good idea, we'll make it happen together,"" he decided to seek him out. After meeting in the city of Portofino, Doris pitched Berlusconi his idea: a financial services company that offered a wide variety of products. In 1982, they founded Programma Italia, which promoted the use of financing and credit. Restructured in 1996 into Mediolanum, which they took public that year, the firm, with Doris as CEO, offers life insurance, fund management, real estate loans, and other products. In December 2015, Mediolanum merged with its fully-owned banking unit Banca Mediolanum in order to streamline its business; it now trades as the latter. Doris reimbursed his clients for their losses in the aftermath of the Lehman Brothers collapse, costing Mediolanum approximately $220 million and a dividend cut.

He left his previous gig at Pacific Investment Management Company (PIMCO), the investment management firm he cofounded in 1971, on bad terms in September 2014. His Total Return Fund had been lagging peers; the SEC was investigating a PIMCO ETF; his heir-apparent, Mohamed El-Erian, had departed amid controversy over Gross' management style; and some of his deputies were publicly criticizing his market views. At PIMCO Gross managed as much as $293 billion in assets at one point. In October 2015 Gross filed a lawsuit against PIMCO, seeking at least $200 million in damages (which he will reportedly donate to charity). He says a ""cabal"" of managing directors plotted to drive him out of the company; PIMCO asked for the suit to be dismissed. Gross got a psych degree from Duke and spent time as a professional blackjack player before serving aboard a Navy destroyer in Vietnam and getting an MBA from UCLA.

Forced to sell assets to raise capital, Gerling Konzern became a shadow of its former self.  Deutsche Bank, after having raised is stake to 34.5% through capital injections, bailed out in 2003, basically receiving in exchange for its interest a share of the credit insurer Gerling NCM, which had been hived off in a deal involving another Gerling Konzern shareholder, Swiss Re. Finally, in 2005, Gerling sold his 94% stake in Gerling Konzern to Talanx Group, Germany's third-largest insurance company, for an estimated $1 billion. A passionate environmentalist who lives in Switzerland, Gerling, while overseeing Gerling Konzern, raised awareness of environmental-related risk factors within the insurance industry.

In 1947, Koo's grandfather, Koo In-Hwoi, co-founded Lucky Chemical Industrial Corp. and began making a popular face cream called Lucky. Manufacturing caps and jars for the cream paved the way for Lucky to become Korea's first mass-producer of plastic goods. Koo began his career with the group in 1975, as a manager at LG Chemical (now LG Chem). He jumped to the group's flagship affiliate, LG Electronics, in 1980. Since becoming chairman of LG Group in 1995, succeeding his father Koo Cha-Kyung, the conglomerate's sales have risen from around $38 billion to over $140 billion. While LG has kept up a brisk pace of innovation, threats to market power from Chinese corporations loom large for both LG and domestic rival Samsung. LG, meanwhile, is investing heavily in organic light-emitting diode (OLED) technology to secure a leading position in the market for next-generation display panels for TVs, smartphones and other applications.

Kerimov borrowed heavily to buy stakes in Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, Deutsche Bank and others. He soon lost billions, but began investing again in the Russian market with the help of loans from VTB Bank. He bought a stake in Polyus Gold, the nation's largest gold mining outfit; Rostelecom, a leading telecom company; and billionaire Dmitry Rybolovlev's stake in Uralkali. In August 2013, Belarusian authorities arrested Uralkali's CEO, saying he abused his power and embezzled funds while his company was involved in a trading alliance with Belaruskali, a government-owned fertilizer company. The authorities said the companies could resume their relationship if Kerimov got rid of his stake, so he sold it to billionaires Mikhail Prokhorov and Dmitry Mazepin. By early 2015, he had sold substantially all of his other assets except the stake in Polyus Gold, which he bought out after borrowing $5.5 billion.

Today, Ashley Furniture has $3.85 billion in sales from beds, sofas, tables and chairs. Part of its success comes from its low prices, achieved by making components  in Asia where labor is cheaper, then shipping it to America to assemble after an order is complete, lowering inventory costs. OSHA fined the company $1.76 million in February 2015 after finding more than 1,000 work-related injuries over a 36-month span. It also added it to the Severe Violator Enforcement Program.

By 1994 Denegri had built Piaggio into a $1.2 billion company; he sold off his majority stake and relinquished his role as chairman. He then moved to private equity through Iniziativa Piemonte, the precursor to today's Investimenti e Partecipazioni, and made his biggest bet ever. In 2000, Denegri's Investimenti built a stake in distressed biotech firm DiaSorin, acquiring it from American firm Standard Companies. DiaSorin is now a global player in the field of in vitro diagnostics -- tests for diseases and infections -- with revenues of $495 million. Investimenti, run by Denegri's son Michele, has a diverse portfolio, including medical technology, real estate, and TV production.

Two years later they founded their design firm and a year after that the label made its runway debut at Milan Fashion Week.

In early 2015, Shin Dong-Joo was dismissed from his executive positions within the group. He had been overseeing Lotte's Japanese affiliates, which comprise a significantly smaller share of the group's assets than the Korean affiliates overseen by his brother, Shin Dong-Bin. Now the brothers are embroiled in a bitter feud for control over the group. Adding to the intrigue is a complex corporate structure in which key ownership breakdowns are obscured by Japanese holding companies. Although Korea's Fair Trade Commission watchdog has been investigating the structure, it has yet to release the details necessary to determine if Shin Kyeok-Ho is a billionaire and allow for a more comprehensive net worth assessment of his sons. The group's biggest project ever, meanwhile -- ""a global city of the future"" -- is rising in Seoul's Songpa neighborhood.

According to a comprehensive Euromonitor report on the German beer industry, Veltins' share of the German market was 3.2% in 2013. Annual revenues are estimated at close to $800 million. Veltins is a longtime sponsor of one of the most popular soccer clubs in Germany's premiere Bundesliga, FC Schalke 04. The team's home field is the Veltins-Arena in Gelsenkirchen, which has a retractable roof and can accommodate over 60,000 fans.

Friese grew up poor in rural Pennsylvania, and enlisted in the Army straight out of high school in 1958. Three years later he moved to California with $125 in his pocket. He landed in the warehouse of C.R. Laurence, which was just a small distributor of supplies. Friese was employee number six. He climbed the ladder, steadily amassing equity in the company until he owned 100%. He expanded by purchasing competitors and moving into manufacturing. In August 2015, Friese sold C.R. Laurence to Oldcastle BuildingEnvelope, a subsidiary of Irish building-materials conglomerate CRH for $1.3 billion. Out of his proceeds from the deal -- about $885 million after taxes -- Friese gave his employees $85 million. All 1,600 of the employees who had worked for the company for than a year got a bonus check -- some got more than $1 million.

The contract for the reconstruction of the stadium by developer division of Sinara group of companies was signed with Russian Ministry of Sport in 2015. Graduating from the Urals Polytechnic Institute with a concentration in metallurgy, Pumpyansky began as a trader, then oversaw several metals plants in the Urals during the 1990s before taking over the Sinarsky Pipe Factory. Joining hands with fellow billionaires Sergei Popov and Andrei Melnichenko, Pumpyansky became CEO of MDM Group, acquiring 35% of pipe conglomerate TMK. In full acquisition mode, MDM clashed with Mikhail Fridman's Alfa Group for control of a fourth major pipe factory and won. Seeking further consolidation, Pumpyansky bought out Melnichenko and Popov in late 2006, and listed TMK on the London Stock Exchange, raising $1 billion.
