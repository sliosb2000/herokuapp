Specializing in the highest end of jewelry retailing, Graff has 33 stores worldwide. Clients include the Sultan and Queen of Brunei and Donald Trump.

Graff attracted attention in November when he bought the highest-priced gem ever sold at auction, a 24.78-carat pink diamond he bid on over the phone at a Sotheby's sale in Geneva. He named the stone the Graff Pink. Graff broke his own record, the 2008 purchase at auction of a $24 million, 31-carat blue diamond he renamed the Graff-Wittelsbach.
