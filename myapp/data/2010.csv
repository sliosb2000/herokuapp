He scored a publicity coup in January when the Smithsonian unveiled a temporary exhibit of his 31-carat blue diamond, recently bought by Graff at auction in December 2008 for $24 million and renamed the Graff-Wittelsbach. The stone is in the same gallery as the renowned Hope Diamond. A self-made tycoon, Graff spent childhood in London's gritty East End, dropping out of school at age 14 to become a jeweler's apprentice. In 2008 Graff achieved full vertical integration when he bought a stake in publicly traded diamond miner Gem Diamonds. Other assets include jewelry company Graff Diamonds International, a polished diamond trading company in Antwerp, a real estate company in Luxembourg and a stake in a South African diamond wholesaler. Graff splits his time between homes in Gstaad, London, Cap Ferrat, New York City and his 150-foot Feadship yacht.
