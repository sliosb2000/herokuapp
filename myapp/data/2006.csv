The crown jewel: Manhattan's Plaza Hotel, snapped up for $675 million last year. Tshuva's Cinderella story began in Netanya in a single room where his penniless family of 11 lived briefly. By the Seventies, following his compulsory service in the Israeli army, Tshuva became a contractor and later earned a tidy fortune in the construction boom that coincided with the influx of Soviet Jews to Israel during the 1980s and early 90's. But it wasn't until 1998, when he orchestrated a hostile takeover of Delek, Israel's second-largest oil and gas company, that he became a household name in Israel. Made headlines last year after he tussled with New York City labor leaders and politicos-including city's mayor, fellow billionaire Michael Bloomberg-over fate of the Plaza and its 900 employees.
